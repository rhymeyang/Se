Smart City as a systems of systems</span></a></h2><ul><li>Although the Smart City idea originated with the goal of providing smart transportation services, other city infrastructure and service systems have become an integral part of the broader Smart City platform and formed a true ‘systems of systems (SoS)’ paradigm.</li><li>According to Popper et al., an SoS is ‘a collection of task-oriented or dedicated systems that pool their resources and capabilities together to obtain a new, more complex “metasystem” which offers more functionality and performance than simply the sum of the constituent systems’.</li><li>Because of numerous interactions of different SoS components, a Smart City is explained in this section in the context of an SoS by reviewing major infrastructure and service systems.</li></ul><h3 id="_3-1-transportation-systems" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-1-transportation-systems"><span>3.1 Transportation

mobility services for goods and people, modern transportation systems have been transforming to a smart and intelligent platform supported by V2V, vehicle-to-human (V2H) and V2I communications.</li></ul><p><img src="/Se/images/306/w1103.png" alt="Picture1"></p><p>Figure 11.3 A general illustration of smart transportation system.</p><h4 id="_3-1-1-smart-vehicles"

and form in-vehicle CPS, they do not communicate with other vehicles or transportation infrastructure.</li><li>Advanced vehicle models are equipped with multiple sensors to support safety and mobility features.</li><li>These features include automatic emergency braking system, blind spot warning system, adaptive cruise control system, rear cross-traffic warning system, and lane departure warning system.</li><li>These features provide the vehicle with significant safety and mobility benefits.</li><li>In addition to these features, several high-end vehicle models use cloud services to support advanced drivers’ assistance systems.</li><li>With the rapid progress in research and development, experts predict that automated vehicles will be ready for mass deployment within the next decade.</li><li>Automated vehicles combine multiple sensing technologies (e.g., LiDAR, camera), navigation systems, motion planning algorithms and control systems for driverless transportation of passengers and goods.</li><li>Sensing technologies can identify any obstacles on a vehicle’s path.</li><li>Navigation systems conduct path planning to reach the trip destination from an

have been deploying technologies to sense, collect and provide transportation system-level condition assessments and predictions to improve safety, mobility and environmental performance.</li><li>Smart transportation infrastructure will accelerate the deployment of automated and connected vehicles.</li><li>Several approaches have been taken by many cities and regions to deploy smart transportation infrastructure such as automated toll collection systems, adaptive signal control, smart streetlights and more.</li><li>Electronic toll collection systems have been deployed throughout the world to lessen congestion by allowing vehicles to move fast through toll collection facilities.</li><li>Fig. 11.4 illustrates a typical example of electronic toll collection infrastructure, which includes six major components (numbered 1 to 6).</li><li>When a vehicle breaks the first laser beam (1) entering the toll zone and triggers the transceiver (2), the transceiver communicates with the vehicle’s onboard transponder and captures the date, time and toll charge.</li><li>Simultaneously, a camera (3) takes photos of the vehicle’s front licence plate.</li><li>Next, the vehicle passes through the second laser beam (4), it triggers the second camera (5) and then the second camera takes photos of the vehicle’s rear licence plate.</li><li>The final step is payment deduction from driver’s account or paid via other options such as a website or bank (6).</li></ul><h4 id="_3-1-3-smart-cloud-services" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor"

will play a critical role in all Smart City infrastructure and service systems.</li><li>Massive amounts of data collected from sensors in smart vehicles and infrastructure will require huge computing resources and could be supported by cloud services.</li><li>Cloud computing has been used to store, process and analyse diverse traffic data (e.g., vehicle condition data, weather and roadway condition data, real-time traffic signal phasing data, social media data).</li><li>Currently, cloud services have been used for numerous transportation applications, such as adaptive signal operations, real-time traffic condition assessment and prediction applications.</li><li>For example, BMW has launched the smartphone application (app) ‘Enlighten’ to communicate real-time corridor traffic signal information to the drivers of selected vehicle models.</li><li>This app combines data from a city’s traffic management system (i.e., signal data) in a cloud infrastructure and shares route-specific traffic signal data with drivers.</li><li>Using the GPS on a smartphone, this application pinpoints any upcoming signals and analyses the distance between the vehicle and signal.</li><li>With this information, the application notifies the driver whether he/she can maintain the same speed or if they need to slow down.</li><li>‘Enlighten’ enables stress-free driving by using cloud service-based data collection, processing and analytics tools.</li></ul><h4 id="_3-1-4-next-generation-air-transportation-system" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor"

transportation systems are two major transportation modes for long-distance passenger and freight movement.</li><li>Because of the high speed, reliability and safety record of air transportation, millions of people use air transportation for long-distance travel.</li><li>Due to an unprecedented increase in air transportation demand, major airports around the world have been experiencing capacity issues.</li><li>In the last century, the modernisation in the air transportation system was not sufficient to serve growing demand.</li><li>To address this issue, the United States has been leading the development and deployment of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) and related CPS infrastructure.</li><li>The Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO) of the USDOT started the initiative to develop the NextGen concept of operations in 2003 to provide the required flexibility in terms of air transportation system capacity including security management and mitigation of the impacts of environment such as air quality and aircraft noise.</li><li>NextGen has set a target to achieve its vision by 2025 and their major objectives are (1) reducing cost, (2) reducing travel time and increasing reliability, (3) fulfilling the future demand and expectation, (4) improving air safety and security of the United States and worldwide air transportation system, (5) mitigating the impacts of weather and other disruptions, (6) reducing noise, fuel consumption and emissions and (7) preventing future threats.</li></ul><hr><ul><li>According to JPDO, the NextGen system will have nine main capabilities: (1) air transportation security, (2) collaborative flow contingency management, (3) efficient trajectory management, (4) collaborative capacity management, (5) flexible separation management, (6) improved environmental performance, (7) improved safety operations, (8) flexible airport facility and ramp operations and (9) integrated NextGen information.</li><li>To achieve these capabilities, NextGen program’s operational CPS has been divided into five subsystems and each subsystem has several functions to support all objectives of the NextGen program.</li><li>The key functions are presented in Fig. 11.5.</li><li>Development and deployment of the NextGen CPS is largely dependent on the coordination and communication between aircraft

parking lots brighter by detecting a person/vehicle and/or dim after vehicles and people leave.</li><li>The concept of smart streetlights has evolved.</li><li>These systems can be used to disseminate emergency warnings (e.g., news on upcoming hurricane) or display important information (e.g., status of approaching signal through a connected display unit).</li><li>Smart streetlights can reduce energy consumption significantly by demand-based utilisation of energy.</li><li>A networked LED streetlighting system can connect with emergency services such as 911 and could promote safer highways
