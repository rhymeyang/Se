Introductionâ€‹</span></a></h2><p>Human Factors (HF), also known as â€˜ergonomicsâ€™, are defined as the scientific discipline concerned with the understanding of interactions amongst humans and other elements of a system.â€‹</p><p>The rationale behind HF is to understand how a system can be designed so that it is suitable for the intended user by complimenting their abilities, as opposed to users adapting to a design that is challenging.â€‹</p><p>To achieve this, it is necessary to understand the variability within the user community, including age, cognitive ability, cultural diversity and physical ability.â€‹</p><p>HF are considered by the UK Ministry of Defense as a systematic systems engineering process known as Human Factors Integration (HFI), which identifies, tracks and resolves human-related considerations, to ensure a balanced development in terms of technologies and human aspects.â€‹</p><p>This concept can be applied during the development of Transportation Cyber-Physical Systems, together with user-centred design, UX and universal design, to ensure that the system meets expectations.â€‹</p><p>There are many examples of cyber-physical systems in the transportation sector where the HF approach has been adopted including aircraft flight decks, air traffic control systems and the design of vehicles.â€‹</p><p>Smart Automated Transport and Retrieval System (SmartATRS) is considered as a Transportation Cyber-Physical System where usability evaluations are conducted to assess the suitability of a system for the user community of people with reduced physical ability.â€‹</p><h2 id="_2-related-human-factors-approachesâ€‹" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-related-human-factors-approachesâ€‹"><span>2. Related human factors approachesâ€‹</span></a></h2><p>In order to develop SmartATRS, it was necessary to consider aspects of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) in terms of ergonomics of Human System Interaction(HSI), Universal Design and Design for All The ISO standard of ergonomics of HIS was originally recognised as Human-Centred Design (HCD). â€‹</p><p>It can be defined as an iterative process consisting of five core stages. â€‹</p><p>The first stage is to understand the context of use in order to generate user requirements. â€‹</p><p>The requirements are then utilised to produce design solutions that can be evaluated against the user requirements. â€‹</p><p>The iterative nature of HCD is produced by the involvement of users during the design process, which could lead to modifications to the design of the system.â€‹</p><h3 id="_2-1-human-factors-integrationâ€‹" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-1-human-factors-integrationâ€‹"><span>2.1 Human factors integrationâ€‹</span></a></h3><p>HFI is considered as a system engineering process that allows the human component of a system to be identified and any human-related aspects that would adversely impact the development to be traded off.â€‹</p><p>The process exists within capability management that concerns the responsibilities of users in capability planning, generation and delivery roles.â€‹</p><p>It is stated that HFI has multiple benefits including minimising errors in the design through thorough correct analysis of HF, resulting in reduced product recalls, development costs, user training and ongoing maintenance costs.â€‹</p><p>HFI consists of a framework containing seven domains to ensure that issues, risks, assumptions, constraints and requirements are captured.â€‹</p><p>These domains are manpower, personnel, training, human factors engineering, system safety, health hazards and social and organizational. â€‹</p><p>The HFI process can be applied to Transportation Cyber-Physical Systems to provide an evaluation of their integration with the existing processes.â€‹</p><h3 id="_2-2-human-centred-designâ€‹" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-2-human-centred-designâ€‹"><span>2.2 Human-centred designâ€‹</span></a></h3><p>One of the key principles of the concept is the involvement of potential users during both the design and development of the system.â€‹</p><p>Placing the user at the centre of the design in order to achieve the ISO Standard can be accomplished by adhering to the four recommendations stated by Norman. â€‹</p><p>It is imperative that a system must be easy to evaluate, the users can determine the actions that are possible at any point in time and the structure of a system must be transparent to users including any conceptual models, alternative actions and the outcomes of actions.â€‹</p><p>Normanâ€™s final recommendation suggests that natural mappings between intentions and required actions should be followed by a system. â€‹</p><p>Norman also defined seven principles of design that ensures the user is assisted when performing tasks. â€‹</p><p>These principles include the creation of understandable operating manuals, simplified task structure to avoid memory overloads, planning for user errors to ensure recovery is always possible and ensuring that it is obvious which actions need to be performed to achieve the system goal.â€‹</p><h3 id="_2-3-usability-evaluationâ€‹" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-3-usability-evaluationâ€‹"><span>2.3 Usability evaluationâ€‹</span></a></h3><p>Usability is defined as the quality of a userâ€™s experience when interacting with products or systems that can be measured in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction.â€‹</p><p>A variety of factors can contribute to usability including the ease of learning, memorability, error frequency and intuitive design, which can be evaluated through participative enquiry through the adoption of methods including focus groups, scenarios, surveys and interviews.â€‹</p><p>An alternative strategy to understand the learnability of a system to new or infrequent users is cognitive walk throughs where a series of tasks are conducted from the userâ€™s perspective.â€‹</p><p>The System Usability Scale (SUS) and NASA TLX are two tools that can be adopted to assess intuitive design and the demands experienced by users when interacting.â€‹</p><p>SUS was originally developed by Brooke to provide a â€˜quick and dirtyâ€™ reliable tool for measuring usability consisting of a 10-item questionnaire with 5 response sections from â€˜strongly agreeâ€™ to â€˜strongly disagreeâ€™.â€‹</p><p>NASA TLX is a subjective workload assessment tool that derives an overall usability score based on the subscales of mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, performance, effort and frustration and thus determines the effect of each interaction modality on the user.â€‹</p><h3 id="_2-4-interaction-modalitiesâ€‹" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-4-interaction-modalitiesâ€‹"><span>2.4 Interaction modalitiesâ€‹</span></a></h3><p>Traditionally, HCI was considered as unimodal where users can only interact through a single channel, e.g., a keyboard.â€‹</p><p>However, it is multimodal as users interact with a variety of devices such as the keyboard, mouse and display to perform tasks.â€‹</p><p>Multimodal systems was originally defined by Oviatt as systems â€˜that process two or more combined user input modes in a coordinated manner with multimedia outputsâ€™.â€‹</p><p>The rationale behind multimodality is to offer alternative channels for users to align with the natural method of interaction in the world (i.e., through the five major senses of sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste).â€‹</p><p>Advances in hardware and software are enabling multimodal systems to emerge where humans are able to interact through natural methods including speech, touch and gesture.â€‹</p><p>The advent of smartphones illustrates multimodal interaction where the device can be operated via a variety of methods.â€‹</p><h2 id="_3-case-studyâ€‹"

Case studyâ€‹</span></a></h2><p>SmartATRS can be considered as a Transportation Cyber-Physical System as it enables a user to transport their powered wheelchair in a vehicle. â€‹</p><p>Furthermore, the system comprises of multiple independently operable constituent systems (e.g., the automated tailgate, platform lift and motorised driverâ€™s seat, as seen in Fig. 8.1) that can only provide the functionality of SmartATRS when combined together as a cyberphysical system. â€‹</p><p>SmartATRS was developed to control an existing assistive technology called the ATRS, originally developed by Freedom Sciences Inc. â€‹</p><p>ATRS is a technically advanced system first featured in New Scientist magazine with the objective of creating a reliable, robust means for a wheelchair user to autonomously dock a powerchair onto a platform lift without the need of an assistant. â€‹</p><p>ATRS requires a standard multipurpose vehicle to be installed with three components; a motorized seat that rotates and exits the vehicle through the driverâ€™s door, an automated tailgate and a platform lift fitted in the rear of the vehicle.â€‹</p><hr><p>Using a joystick attached to the driverâ€™s seat, a user with reduced physical ability manoeuvres the powerchair to the rear of the vehicle until it is adjacent to the lift and within line of sight of two highly reflective fiducials. â€‹</p><p>On an input from the user (via a button press), a laser guidance system comprising a compact Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) unit coupled with robotics fitted to powerchair, locates the exact position of the lift and proceeds to autonomously drive the powerchair onto the platform, as shown in Fig. 8.1.â€‹</p><p><img src="/Se/images/306/w0801.png" alt="image-20241104224004824"></p><p>Figure 8.1 ATRS operating zones.</p><p><img src="/Se/images/306/w0802.png" alt="image-20241104224028687"></p><p>Figure 8.2 Wireless keyfobs used to control ATRS.</p><h3 id="_3-1-requirements" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-1-requirements"><span>3.1 Requirements</span></a></h3><ul><li>SmartATRS was developed to provide the exact functionality of the keyfobs on a smartphone interface.</li><li>Demonstrations of ATRS to users with reduced physical abilities were performed at the 2011 Mobility Roadshow, a UK consumer-based event, showcasing mobility products and innovation.</li><li>Based on the demonstrations at the Mobility Roadshow, requirements were defined for SmartATRS using Volere Requirements Shells and categorised in terms of Functionality (FR), Interoperability (IR), Maintainability (MR), Performance (PR), Portability (PTR), Reliability (RR), Safety (SFR) and Usability (UR).

This clearly highlighted that touch interaction was the most usable, with most participants finding interaction with the head challenging.</li><li>A second important result identified the safety of the emergency stop function with each interaction method.</li><li>The results revealed a standard deviation of 4 s for the fingers compared to 14 s for head tracking.</li><li>The average stopping times were 4 and 16 s, respectively.</li><li>The dramatically increased stop times for head tracking were observed to be the time taken to navigate to the emergency stop button using switch control, indicating that using the head is more unpredictable than fingers.</li></ul><hr><ul><li><strong>NASA TLX</strong>: The box plot comparisons in Fig. 8.9 illustrate the differences in the workload experienced between touch and head-based interaction.</li><li>From the minimum, lower-quartile, median, upper-quartile and maximum values, it is evident that â€˜fingersâ€™ showed lower mental and temporal demands, thus proving that head tracking was more mentally demanding and stressful to complete efficiently.</li><li>A second important observation was the considerably higher physical demand for head tracking resulting in 65% of participants either not being able to sufficiently use switch control at all or finding it extremely challenging.</li><li>The remaining 35% of participants experienced low workload levels when using the head due to having full range of neck movement.</li><li>The limitations of head tracking are also reflected by the increased effort and frustration levels compared to â€˜fingersâ€™.</li><li>Overall the box plots were fairly conclusive that in this particular instance, touch-based interaction was more effective than head interaction.</li></ul><p><img src="/Se/images/306/w0809.png" alt="image-20241104225817183"></p><p>Figure 8.9 Box plot comparison of NASA Task Load Index (TLX) results in terms of (A) Physical Demand, (B) Mental Demand, (C) Effort and (D) Frustration.</p><h4 id="_3-5-6-evaluation-3-touch-and-smartglass-based-interaction" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-5-6-evaluation-3-touch-and-smartglass-based-interaction"><span>3.5.6 Evaluation 3 (touch and smartglass based interaction)</span></a></h4><ul><li>The third evaluation compared touch-based and smartglass interaction mediums to ascertain whether smartglasses could potentially be useful for people with reduced physical ability.</li><li>The evaluation was conducted using the Recon Jet smartglass with participants at the 2016 Mobility Roadshow.</li><li>The simulation of SmartATRS, used for Evaluation 2, was applied to this evaluation to eliminate the use of a vehicle and the ATRS components.</li><li>It was necessary to develop a separate SmartATRS user interface for the Recon Jet due to the small display size, as shown in Fig. 8.10.</li><li>The interface retained an identical layout as the smartphone interface, but the buttons were reduced in size so that all could be viewed on the single screen.</li><li>To enable navigation using the touchpad on the Recon Jet, additional JavaScript code was developed that converted the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) codes produced from the touchpad into onfocus events.</li><li>Due to the poor usability of the Recon Jet previously established during a feasibility trial, it was therefore decided not to conduct a controlled usability evaluation;
