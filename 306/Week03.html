it can start and stop depending on authorisation signals and can trigger interlocking sensors, command or track circuit.</li><li>It is decomposed as a driver and an engine; the driver is reading the signal and provides an acceleration (positive or negative), and the engine integrates this acceleration to provide a position, setting the sensors.</li><li>This version is developed using OpenModelica block representation.</li><li>A more sophisticated CT model reproduces more accurately the behaviour of the train.</li><li>In this version the driver still reads the signals and provides a set point speed.</li><li>Then the engine uses its acceleration and braking capability to try to reach the set point speed.</li><li>The calculation of the position takes account of the track chaining and switch positions.</li></ul><p><img src="/Se/images/306/21.png" alt="image-20241005231944816"></p><p>Figure 3.8 Simple continuous-time model of a train.</p><p><img src="/Se/images/306/22.png" alt="image-20241005232125374"></p><p>Figure 3.9 Continuous-time model of train behaviour in OpenModelica</p><h3 id="_5-5-3-discrete-event-model-of-the-decentralised-controller" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-5-3-discrete-event-model-of-the-decentralised-controller"><span>5.5.3 DISCRETE- EVENT MODEL OF THE DECENTRALISED CONTROLLER</span></a></h3><ul><li>The physical components of the interlock CPS have been addressed, and so it remains to model the cyber controller and this is best done in the DE environment.</li><li>The controller has previously been decomposed into five distributed zonal controllers, and so the challenge for the DE modeller is to model the behaviour of each of those zones.</li><li>Here the behaviour really means the setting of the track signals in response to routes requested by the trains along with their sensed positions.</li></ul><p><img src="/Se/images/306/23.png" alt="image-20241005232519222"></p><p>Figure 3.13 The connection diagram showing the two- model Functional Mock-up Units and their port connections.</p><h2 id="_5-8-hardware-in-the-loop-simulation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-8-hardware-in-the-loop-simulation"><span>5.8 HARDWARE- IN-THE-LOOP SIMULATION</span></a></h2><ul><li>It is possible to perform HiL simulations, where selected component that were previously modelled are replaced with suitably instrumented hardware.</li><li>In the case of the train interlock example, HiL simulations can be performed where the DE controller FMUs, along with the Ethernet FMU, may be replaced with the controller hardware running code generated from DE models.</li></ul><p><img src="/Se/images/306/24.png" alt="image-20241005232843101"></p><p>Figure 3.19 A hardware-in-the-loop simulation of the train interlock system, where the controller and Ethernet Functional Mock-up Units are replaced with generated code running on actual hardware.
