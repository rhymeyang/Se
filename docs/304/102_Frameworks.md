- Cybersecurity Concerns: Risks such as hacking of vehicles, data privacy, network vulnerabilities, and regulatory compliance.
- Relevance to Project Management: Automobility cybersecurity requires precise coordination between engineering, IT, security, legal, and compliance teams.

## Review of PMBOK and Agile in the Context of Cybersecurity

- PMBOK in Cybersecurity:
  - **Emphasizes structured stages**: Initiation, Planning, Execution, Monitoring & Controlling, and Closing.
  - **Key Processes**: Scope Management, Risk Management, Quality Control.
- Agile Methodologies in Cybersecurity:
  - **Flexibility**: Respond quickly to emerging security threats.
  - **Scrum and Kanban**: Useful in sprints for testing and deploying cybersecurity measures.
  - When to Choose Agile or Waterfall: Discussion of hybrid models for automobility.



## Project Constraints

- The Triple Constraint (Scope, Time, Cost):

  - **Scope**: Defining what is included in the project (e.g., what security features to implement, what systems to protect).
  - **Time**: Working within deadlines for compliance or product release.
  - **Cost**: Budgeting for security tools, compliance audits, and technology resources.

- **Adding Quality**: 

  Cybersecurity cannot afford to compromise on quality, especially with safety-critical systems like autonomous vehicles.

- **Balancing All Four**: 

  - Case example: Trade-offs between implementing the latest encryption methods and staying within budget.

## Project Management Models

### History Behind These Models

- **Lean Origins**: Many of these project management models stem from Lean Manufacturing principles developed in Japan, particularly at Toyota, and focus on improving efficiency and reducing waste.
- **Post-WWII Context**: These methods emerged as a response to resource constraints and a need for innovative, resource-efficient production methods.

---

- **Evolution in the Automotive Sector**: As the automotive industry has transitioned toward digitalization and connectivity, these models have been adapted to include elements of software development, cybersecurity, and compliance.
- **Agile in Automotive**: More recently, companies have embraced Agile methodologies, especially in developing connected and autonomous vehicle technology, due to the need for iterative testing and quick responses to security vulnerabilities.

### Toyota’s 3M Model:

- 無駄 Muda (Waste): Focus on eliminating waste from processes, such as inefficiencies in cybersecurity testing or redundant security controls.
- 無理 Muri (Overburden): Preventing overburdening of teams or resources, especially critical in high-stress environments like security operations.
- 斑 Mura (Unevenness): Avoiding inconsistencies or irregularities in workflows, which can lead to vulnerabilities in cybersecurity if left unchecked.

#### History of Toyota’s 3M Model:

- Origins: Part of Toyota's Lean Manufacturing principles, developed post-WWII, to optimize manufacturing processes.
- Application to Cybersecurity: The same principles of eliminating waste, preventing overburden, and ensuring evenness can be adapted to improve the efficiency and reliability of cybersecurity projects.

#### Examples in Automobility Cybersecurity:

- **Muda**: Removing unnecessary steps in the security approval process.
- **Muri**: Ensuring teams aren't overloaded during critical stages like penetration testing or incident response.
- **Mura**: Creating consistent and streamlined procedures for cybersecurity updates.

## Other Project Management Models

### Ford's Integrated Product Development System (IPDS):

- **Overview**: Ford developed IPDS to ensure cross-functional teams collaborate efficiently, focusing on concurrent engineering.
- **Key Features**: Early risk identification, cross-team collaboration, and product lifecycle focus.
- **Application to Cybersecurity**: Emphasizes early-stage risk assessment and collaboration between engineering and cybersecurity teams to address vulnerabilities before launch.

### GM’s Global Product Development System (GPDS):

- **Overview**: A project management framework that emphasizes quality, cost, and timing (QCT) from concept to vehicle launch.
- **Key Elements**: Product lifecycle management, quality assurance at every stage, and stakeholder involvement.
- **Application to Cybersecurity**: Aligns with continuous monitoring and testing of vehicle cybersecurity during development and post-launch.

### Volkswagen’s VW.2025 Strategy:

- **Focus on Digital Transformation**: Part of Volkswagen’s shift toward connected and autonomous vehicles, with a focus on Agile and Lean principles.
- **Application to Cybersecurity**: Agile principles ensure rapid response to emerging cyber threats in connected vehicle systems.

## Risk Management

### Key Risks in Automobility Cybersecurity:

- **Technical Risks**: Vulnerabilities in software and hardware, network breaches.
- **Legal & Compliance Risks**: Meeting regulatory requirements (e.g., UNECE WP.29 cybersecurity regulations).
- **Operational Risks**: Downtime due to cyberattacks, coordination failures across departments.

### Risk Management Plan:

- **Risk Identification**: What could go wrong? (e.g., software vulnerabilities, human error).
- **Risk Assessment**: Ranking risks based on probability and impact.
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Proactive measures (e.g., regular security testing, compliance audits).

## Key Takeaways

Adapting Industry Models: Automotive companies’ project management models can be adapted to address the specific challenges of cybersecurity by:

- Incorporating early-stage risk identification (Ford’s IPDS)
- Emphasizing cross-functional collaboration (Volkswagen’s Agile approach)
- Implementing continuous quality checks (GM’s GPDS)

This broader perspective highlights how traditional automotive project management models can inform the management of cybersecurity efforts in the automobility sector, ensuring alignment with industry standards and addressing the unique challenges of connected and autonomous vehicle security.

## Tools for Cybersecurity PM

### Project Management Tools:

- **MS Project**: Detailed scheduling, resource allocation for managing cybersecurity projects.
- **Visio**: Process mapping for security protocols, data flow diagrams, network infrastructure.
- **Jira/Confluence**: Useful for Agile teams, tracking tasks, and collaboration on security updates.
- **GitHub**: Version control for security patches and compliance documents.

### Communication Tools:

- **Slack/Teams**: For real-time communication between engineering, IT, legal, and compliance.
- **Trello**: Kanban boards for task tracking and assigning security updates.

### Activity / Discussion

**Scenario**: “You're managing a project to secure a new autonomous vehicle fleet. What are the most critical risks you would identify, and how would you prioritize addressing them?”

**Group Activity**: Work in teams (max. 3) to outline a basic risk management plan using the tools introduced.

**Prompt**: "How do you see the unique challenges of automobility cybersecurity influencing project management decisions?"
