## Overview of Automobility Cybersecurity

- Automobility Evolution: Growth in connected and autonomous vehicles, IoT systems, smart infrastructure.
- Cybersecurity Concerns: Risks such as hacking of vehicles, data privacy, network vulnerabilities, and regulatory compliance.
- Relevance to Project Management: Automobility cybersecurity requires precise coordination between engineering, IT, security, legal, and compliance teams.

## Review of PMBOK and Agile in the Context of Cybersecurity

- PMBOK in Cybersecurity:
  - Emphasizes structured stages: Initiation, Planning, Execution,
    Monitoring & Controlling, and Closing.
  - Key Processes: Scope Management, Risk Management, Quality Control.
- AgileMethodologiesinCybersecurity:
  - Flexibility: Respond quickly to emerging security threats.
  - Scrum and Kanban: Useful in sprints for testing and deploying cybersecurity measures.
  - When to Choose Agile or Waterfall: Discussion of hybrid models for automobility.

## Project Constraints

- The Triple Constraint (Scope, Time, Cost):
  - Scope:Definingwhatisincludedintheproject(e.g.,whatsecurity features to implement, what systems to protect).
  - Time:Workingwithindeadlinesforcomplianceorproductrelease.
  - Cost:Budgetingforsecuritytools,complianceaudits,andtechnology
    resources.
- Adding Quality: Cybersecurity cannot afford to compromise on quality, especially with safety-critical systems like autonomous vehicles.
- Balancing All Four: Case example: Trade-offs between implementing the latest encryption methods and staying within budget.

## Project Management Models

### History Behind These Models

- Lean Origins: Many of these project management models stem from Lean Manufacturing principles developed in Japan, particularly at Toyota, and focus on improving efficiency and reducing waste.
- Post-WWII Context: These methods emerged as a response to resource constraints and a need for innovative, resource- efficient production methods.

---

- Evolution in the Automotive Sector: As the automotive industry has transitioned toward digitalization and connectivity, these models have been adapted to include elements of software development, cybersecurity, and compliance.
- Agile in Automotive: More recently, companies have embraced Agile methodologies, especially in developing connected and autonomous vehicle technology, due to the need for iterative testing and quick responses to security vulnerabilities.

### Toyota’s 3M Model:

- 無駄 Muda(Waste):Focusoneliminatingwastefrom processes, such as inefficiencies in cybersecurity testing or redundant security controls.
- 無理 Muri(Overburden):Preventingoverburdeningofteamsor resources, especially critical in high-stress environments like security operations.
- 斑 Mura(Unevenness):Avoidinginconsistenciesor irregularities in workflows, which can lead to vulnerabilities in cybersecurity if left unchecked.

#### History of Toyota’s 3M Model:

- Origins:PartofToyota'sLeanManufacturingprinciples, developed post-WWII, to optimize manufacturing processes.
- ApplicationtoCybersecurity:Thesameprinciplesof eliminating waste, preventing overburden, and ensuring evenness can be adapted to improve the efficiency and reliability of cybersecurity projects.

#### Examples in Automobility Cybersecurity:

- Muda:Removingunnecessarystepsinthesecurityapproval process.
- Muri:Ensuringteamsaren'toverloadedduringcriticalstages like penetration testing or incident response.
- Mura:Creatingconsistentandstreamlinedproceduresfor cybersecurity updates.

## Other Project Management Models

### Ford's Integrated Product Development System (IPDS):

- Overview:ForddevelopedIPDStoensurecross-functional teams collaborate efficiently, focusing on concurrent engineering.
- KeyFeatures:Earlyriskidentification,cross-team collaboration, and product lifecycle focus.
- ApplicationtoCybersecurity:Emphasizesearly-stagerisk assessment and collaboration between engineering and cybersecurity teams to address vulnerabilities before launch.

### GM’s Global Product Development System (GPDS):

- Overview:Aprojectmanagementframeworkthatemphasizes quality, cost, and timing (QCT) from concept to vehicle launch.
- KeyElements:Productlifecyclemanagement,quality assurance at every stage, and stakeholder involvement.
- ApplicationtoCybersecurity:Alignswithcontinuous monitoring and testing of vehicle cybersecurity during development and post-launch.

### Volkswagen’s VW.2025 Strategy:

- FocusonDigitalTransformation:PartofVolkswagen’sshift toward connected and autonomous vehicles, with a focus on Agile and Lean principles.
- ApplicationtoCybersecurity:Agileprinciplesensurerapid response to emerging cyber threats in connected vehicle systems.

## Risk Management

### Key Risks in Automobility Cybersecurity:

- TechnicalRisks:Vulnerabilitiesinsoftwareandhardware,networkbreaches.
- Legal&ComplianceRisks:Meetingregulatoryrequirements(e.g.,UNECE WP.29 cybersecurity regulations).
- OperationalRisks:Downtimeduetocyberattacks,coordinationfailures across departments.

### Risk Management Plan:

- RiskIdentification:Whatcouldgowrong?(e.g.,softwarevulnerabilities, human error).
- RiskAssessment:Rankingrisksbasedonprobabilityandimpact.
- MitigationStrategies:Proactivemeasures(e.g.,regularsecuritytesting, compliance audits).

## Key Takeaways

Adapting Industry Models: Automotive companies’ project management models can be adapted to address the specific challenges of cybersecurity by:

- Incorporating early-stage risk identification (Ford’s IPDS)
- Emphasizing cross-functional collaboration (Volkswagen’s Agile
  approach)
- Implementing continuous quality checks (GM’s GPDS)

This broader perspective highlights how traditional automotive project management models can inform the management of cybersecurity efforts in the automobility sector, ensuring alignment with industry standards and addressing the unique challenges of connected and autonomous vehicle security.

## Tools for Cybersecurity PM

### Project Management Tools:

- MS Project: Detailed scheduling, resource allocation for managing cybersecurity projects.
- Visio: Process mapping for security protocols, data flow diagrams, network infrastructure.
- Jira/Confluence: Useful for Agile teams, tracking tasks, and collaboration on security updates.
- GitHub: Version control for security patches and compliance documents.
- ### Communication Tools:
- Slack/Teams: For real-time communication between engineering, IT, legal, and compliance.
- Trello: Kanban boards for task tracking and assigning security updates.

### Activity / Discussion

Scenario: “You're managing a project to secure a new autonomous vehicle fleet. What are the most critical risks you would identify, and how would you prioritize addressing them?”

Group Activity: Work in teams (max.3) to outline a basic risk management plan using the tools introduced.

Prompt: "How do you see the unique challenges of automobility cybersecurity influencing project management decisions?"
