## Q3

1. In Earned Value Management (EVM), a Cost Performance Index (CPI) greater than 1 indicates cost overruns.
   - True
   - False
   - Explain:
     - False
     - In Earned Value Management (EVM), a Cost Performance Index (CPI) greater than 1 indicates that the project is performing better than expected in terms of cost. Specifically:
       - `CPI > 1`: Cost efficiency is good; the project is spending less money than planned for the amount of work completed.
       - `CPI < 1`: Cost overruns; the project is spending more money than planned for the amount of work completed.
       - `CPI = 1`: The project is on budget.
2. ISO/SAE 21434 focuses exclusively on technical risks in automotive cybersecurity.
   - True
   - False
   - Explain:
     - False
     - ISO/SAE 21434 does not focus exclusively on technical risks. It provides a comprehensive framework for managing cybersecurity in the automotive industry, covering not only technical risks but also organizational, process, and lifecycle considerations. This includes risk assessment, threat identification, mitigation, and management throughout the entire lifecycle of a vehicle, from concept to decommissioning.
3. In an Agile context, which tool is used to visually track tasks during a sprint?
   - a. Gantt Chart
   - b. Risk Matrix
   - c. Kanban or Scrum Board
   - d. Earned Value Chart
   - Explain:
     - c. Kanban or Scrum Board
     - In an Agile context, a Kanban or Scrum Board is used to visually track tasks during a sprint. These boards typically display tasks in columns such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done," allowing teams to monitor progress and manage workflow efficiently.
4. Compliance risks in automobility cybersecurity can only arise during the project initiation phase.
   - True
   - False
   - Explain:
     - False
     - Compliance risks in automobility cybersecurity can arise at any phase of a project, not just during the initiation phase. These risks can occur throughout the entire project lifecycle, including design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance, as regulatory requirements, industry standards, or legal obligations might evolve or be identified at different stages.
5. Which of the following metrics is used to measure schedule performance in EVM?
   - a. Schedule Performance Index (SPI)
   - b. Actual Cost (AC)
   - c. Earned Value (EV)
   - d.Cost Variance (CV)
   - Explain:
     - a. Schedule Performance Index (SPI)
     - The Schedule Performance Index (SPI) is the metric used to measure schedule performance in **Earned Value Management (EVM)**. It is calculated as:
       - `SPI=Earned Value (EV)/Planned Value (PV)`
     - `SPI > 1`: The project is ahead of schedule.
     - `SPI < 1`: The project is behind schedule.
     - `SPI = 1`: The project is on schedule.
6. In ISO 31000, which step follows risk assessment?
   - a. Risk treatment.
   - b. Risk communication.
   - c. Risk monitoring.
   - d. Risk identification.
   - Explain:
     - a. Risk treatment
     - In ISO 31000, the step that follows risk assessment is risk treatment. The process involves determining appropriate actions to address identified risks, such as mitigating, transferring, avoiding, or accepting them. This step is crucial for managing risks effectively after they have been identified, analyzed, and evaluated during the risk assessment phase.
7. Agile methodology does not support Earned Value Management (EVM) as a monitoring tool.
   - True
   - False
   - Explain:
     - False
     - Agile methodology can support **Earned Value Management (EVM)** as a monitoring tool. While Agile emphasizes flexibility and iterative development, EVM can be adapted to Agile projects to monitor cost and schedule performance. Agile frameworks often track progress through story points, sprints, or completed iterations, and these can be used as input for calculating EVM metrics like **Earned Value (EV)** and **Cost Performance Index (CPI)**. Thus, EVM and Agile are not mutually exclusive and can be complementary when applied appropriately.
8. Risk response strategies, such as avoidance and mitigation, should only be applied to high-priority risks.
   - True
   - False
   - Explain:
     - False
     - Risk response strategies, such as **avoidance** and **mitigation**, should not be applied only to high-priority risks. While high-priority risks often require immediate attention, all identified risks should be evaluated, and appropriate strategies should be applied based on their likelihood and impact. Lower-priority risks might also require responses, such as monitoring or contingency planning, to prevent them from escalating.
9. Matching the terms with their descriptions:
   - **Risk Treatment** → C. A risk management activity focusing on developing responses like avoidance or mitigation.
   - **Earned Value (EV)** → B. Represents the value of work completed at a given time in EVM.
   - **SWOT Analysis** → E. Analyzes internal and external factors impacting a project, categorized as strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
   - **Risk Burndown Chart** → D. A visual tool used in Agile projects to track mitigation of high-priority risks.
   - **Compliance Verification** → A. Verification of adherence to standards such as ISO/SAE 21434 and UNECE WP.29.
10. A risk matrix uses qualitative scales to assess and prioritize risks.
    - True
    - False
    - Explain:
      - True
      - A **risk matrix** uses **qualitative scales** (such as "Low," "Medium," and "High") to assess and prioritize risks based on their **likelihood** and **impact**. It provides a simple visual tool to help stakeholders understand the relative severity of risks and focus on those requiring immediate attention. Quantitative scales can also be incorporated in more detailed analyses, but qualitative scales are commonly used for initial assessments.
11. If the Planned Value (PV) is $200,000, Earned Value (EV) is $180,000, and Actual Cost (AC) is $190,000, what is its Schedule Variance (SV) and Cost Variance (CV) and how can it be interpreted?
    - a. Its SV is -$20,000 (Behind Schedule) and CV is -$10,000 (Over Budget)
    - b. Its SV is -$10,000 (Behind Schedule) and CV is -$20,000 (Over Budget)
    - c. Its SV is +$20,000 (Ahead of Schedule) and CV is +$10,000 (Under Budget)
    - d. Its SV is +$10,000 (Ahead of Schedule) and CV is +$20,000 (Under Budget)
    - Explain:
      - a. Its SV is -$20,000 (Behind Schedule) and CV is -$10,000 (Over Budget)
      - To calculate **Schedule Variance (SV)** and **Cost Variance (CV)**:
        - Schedule Variance (SV):
          - `SV = EV − PV`
          - `SV = 180,000 − 200,000 = −20,000`
        - Cost Variance (CV):
          - `CV = EV − AC`
          - `CV = 180,000 − 190,000 = −10,000`
        - Interpretation:
          - `SV = -$20,000`: The project is **behind schedule** because Earned Value (EV) is less than Planned Value (PV).
          - `CV = -$10,000`: The project is **over budget** because Earned Value (EV) is less than Actual Cost (AC).
12. Risk matrices are used to evaluate and prioritize risks based on their likelihood and impact.
    - True
    - False
    - Explain:
      - True
      - **Risk matrices** are tools used to evaluate and prioritize risks by plotting them on a grid based on their **likelihood** (probability of occurrence) and **impact** (severity of consequences). This visual representation helps decision-makers focus on the most critical risks and decide on appropriate mitigation strategies.
13. Which of the following is a compliance risk in automobility cybersecurity?
    - a. Vulnerability in encryption protocols.
    - b. Unauthorized access to onboard systems.
    - c. Insufficient patch management.

    - a. To prioritize project deliverables.
    - b. To record and monitor identified risks.
    - c. To allocate project resources.
    - d. To document lessons learned.
    - Explanation:
      - b. To record and monitor identified risks.
      - The primary purpose of a risk register in a project is to serve as a centralized document that records and monitors identified risks throughout the project lifecycle. It includes details such as the description of risks, their likelihood, impact, mitigation strategies, and status. This helps in tracking risks effectively and ensuring they are addressed appropriately.
15. n the Agile methodology, monitoring and controlling focus only on completed sprints.
    - True
    - False
    - Explain:
      - False
      - In the Agile methodology, **monitoring and controlling** focus on both **ongoing and completed sprints**. Agile emphasizes continuous improvement and iterative progress, which means teams monitor current sprint activities while also reviewing past sprints to identify lessons learned and areas for improvement. This approach ensures that the project remains aligned with goals and adapts to changes effectively.
16. What tool would best help a project manager prioritize risks?
    - a. SWOT Analysis
    - b. Risk Matrix
    - c. Task Board
    - d. Gantt Chart
    - Explanation:

    - c. Risk Identification
    - d. Risk Treatment
    - Explanation:
      - b. Risk Reinforcement
      - Risk Reinforcement is not a recognized step in the risk management process outlined in ISO 31000. The key steps in the ISO 31000 framework include:
        - Risk Identification: Identifying potential risks.
        - Risk Assessment: Analyzing and evaluating risks.
        - Risk Treatment: Addressing risks through mitigation, avoidance, transfer, or acceptance.
        - Risk Monitoring and Review: Continuously monitoring risks and their management effectiveness.
18. Matching the terms with their definitions:
    - **Risk Response Planning** → E. Prepares mitigation, avoidance, transfer, or acceptance strategies for identified risks.
    - **Cost Variance (CV)** → D. Measures cost efficiency in EVM; calculated as EV - AC.
    - **ISO 31000** → B. Guides risk management frameworks for consistency and improved decision-making.
    - **SWOT Analysis** → A. A process for identifying and evaluating project strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
    - **Planned Value (PV)** → C. The budgeted cost of work scheduled to be completed by a specific date.
19. What is the primary objective of a Sprint Retrospective in Agile methodology?
    - a. Prioritize tasks for the next sprint.
    - b. Present features to stakeholders for approval.
    - c. Reflect on the sprint process and implement improvements.
    - d. Review completed tasks and gather stakeholder feedback.
    - Explanation:
      - c. Reflect on the sprint process and implement improvements.
      - The primary objective of a **Sprint Retrospective** in Agile methodology is to allow the team to **reflect on the sprint process**, identify what went well, what didn't, and how they can improve in future sprints. This fosters continuous improvement and enhances team collaboration and efficiency. It focuses on the process, not the deliverables, which are typically reviewed in the **Sprint Review**.
20. In the monitoring and controlling process, which activity focuses on analyzing trends to predict project performance?
    - a. Defect Tracking
    - b. Stakeholder Feedback Collection
    - c. Earned Value Analysis (EVA)
    - d. Stakeholder Feedback Collection
    - Explanation:
      - c. Earned Value Analysis (EVA)
      - In the monitoring and controlling process, Earned Value Analysis (EVA) focuses on analyzing project performance trends. EVA integrates scope, cost, and schedule data to assess how the project is progressing and predict its future performance. Metrics like Cost Performance Index (CPI) and Schedule Performance Index (SPI) are used to forecast potential deviations from the project baseline.
21. If the SPI of a project is 0.85 and BAC is $150,000, what is the forecasted Estimate at Completion (EAC)?
    - a. $176,470.59 (Projected over budget)
    - b. $150,000.85 (Projected over budget)
    - c. $149,999.15 (Projected under budget)
    - d. $127,500 (Projected under budget)
    - Explanation:
      - To calculate the Estimate at Completion (EAC) based on the Schedule Performance Index (SPI):
        - The formula for EAC using SPI is:
          - `EAC = BAC/SPI`
        - Given:
          - SPI = 0.85
          - BAC = $150,000
          - `EAC = 150,000/0.85 =176,470.59`
        - Interpretation:
          - `EAC = $176,470.59` indicates the project is projected to be **over budget** due to a schedule performance issue.
22. Schedule Variance (SV) measures the efficiency of cost utilization in a project.

- True
- False
- Explanation:
  - False
  - **Schedule Variance (SV)** does not measure the efficiency of cost utilization; instead, it measures the difference between the Earned Value (EV) and the Planned Value (PV) to assess whether the project is ahead or behind schedule.
  - The formula for SV is:
    - `SV = EV − PV`
  - Cost efficiency is measured by the **Cost Performance Index (CPI)** or **Cost Variance (CV)**.

23. Regular stakeholder communication is optional during the monitoring and controlling processes.
    - True
    - False
    - Explanation:
      - False
      - Regular stakeholder communication is essential during the monitoring and controlling processes. Keeping stakeholders informed ensures transparency, helps manage expectations, and facilitates decision-making. It also enables stakeholders to provide feedback and address any issues or changes promptly, ensuring the project stays aligned with its objectives.
24. Which metric measures the efficiency of risk resolution over time in Agile projects?
    - a. Sprint Velocity
    - b. Defect Density
    - c. Sprint Velocity
    - d. Cost Performance Index (CPI)
    - Explanation:
      - a. Sprint Velocity
      - In Agile projects, **Sprint Velocity** can indirectly measure the efficiency of risk resolution over time. It reflects the amount of work completed in a sprint, and improvements in velocity often indicate the team's growing ability to handle risks, blockers, and challenges effectively.
      - Metrics like **Defect Density** or **Cost Performance Index (CPI)** are not specifically designed for Agile risk resolution.
25. A project has the following data: Budget at Completion (BAC) = $300,000, Earned Value (EV) = $120,000, Actual Cost (AC) = $150,000. The Cost Performance Index (CPI) and interpreted results are:
    + a. `CPI = 0.8` and the project is experiencing cost overruns as `CPI < 1`
    + b. `CPI = 0.5` and the project is experiencing cost overruns as `CPI < 1`
    + c. `CPI = 2` and the project is cost-efficient as `CPI > 1`
    + d. `CPI = 1.25` and the project is cost-efficient as `CPI > 1`
    + Explanation:
      + a. `CPI = 0.8` and the project is experiencing cost overruns as `CPI < 1`
      + To calculate the Cost Performance Index (CPI):
        + The formula is:
          + `CPI = Earned Value (EV)/Actual Cost (AC)`
        + Given:
          + EV = $120,000
          + AC = $150,000
          + `CPI = 120,000/150,000 = 0.8`
        + Interpretation:
          + `CPI = 0.8`: The project is experiencing **cost overruns** because the CPI is less than 1. This indicates that for every dollar spent, the project is only earning $0.80 worth of work.
