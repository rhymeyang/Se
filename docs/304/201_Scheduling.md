# Project Scheduling

## Project Scheduling

### Objective:
+ Balancing Time, Scope, and Resources in a Regulated Environment
Definition:
+ Refers to the process of organizing tasks, milestones, and deliverables into a timeline


### Objective:

+ Create a structured plan to ensure timely project delivery while balancing resources and constraints
Context in Cybersecurity:
+ Critical for managing compliance with security standards (ISO/SAE 21434) and ensuring deadlines are met in automobility development cycles
 
### Project Scheduling (PMBOK)

Role of Scheduling: Integral to the Planning and Monitoring phases, where time management is key to maintaining scope, cost, and quality. Crucial component of project management in the context of automobility cybersecurity.

+ Falls primarily within the Planning phase of the Project Management Institute's (PMI) Project Lifecycle, as outlined in the Project Management Body of Knowledge.
+ Project Scheduling is part of the Planning Process Group and closely related to the Time Management Knowledge Area.
+ Involves defining and sequencing activities, estimating activity durations, and developing the overall project schedule.

## Project Scheduling (Waterfall)
Project scheduling is done upfront, with a detailed timeline and sequential project stages are created for the entire project. Activities are sequenced linearly, and each phase must be completed before moving to the next and crucial for predicting timelines.

+ Benefits:
  + Predictable timelines
  + Easier to manage in highly regulated environments (e.g., UNECE WP.29)
+ Challenges:
  + Less flexibility for changes, which can impact emerging cybersecurity threats

Use in Automobility: Common in long-term projects with high regulatory requirements (e.g., Ford’s automotive production cycles).

## Project Scheduling (Agile)

Agile uses iterative development, with more flexibility in adjusting schedules. The schedule is regularly updated based on progress and changing priorities.

+ Key Elements: Sprints, time-boxed iterations, and adaptive planning. 
+ Benefits:
  + Fast response to changing cybersecurity risks
  + Flexible to handle evolving automobility technologies (e.g., connected
car updates) 
+ Challenges:
  + Uncertainty in long-term schedule predictions

Application in Automobility: Volkswagen and GM adopt Agile in software and cybersecurity development for electric and connected vehicles.

## Regulatory Compliance

### ISO/SAE 21434:

+ Requires cybersecurity management across the entire lifecycle, including scheduling timelines for compliance, monitoring and decommissioning.
+ Key scheduling element: Integrating security checkpoints at each phase. 

### UNECE WP.29:

+ Mandates specific timelines for cybersecurity updates in connected vehicles, influencing how automobility projects are scheduled.
+ Implementation of a Cybersecurity Management System (CSMS). 

### ISO 31000:
+ Emphasizes risk management integration with project scheduling, ensuring risks (legal, technical, compliance) are mitigated through proper time allocation planning and regular risk assessments.

## Automotive Management Models 

### Toyota’s 3M (Muda, Mura, Muri):
+ Focus on eliminating waste, unevenness, and overburden to optimize project timelines.
+ Scheduling is highly focused on reducing delays and inefficiencies.
+ Uses the Toyota Production System (TPS), which emphasizes continuous improvement and just-in-time production.
+ Project scheduling focuses on eliminating waste and optimizing flow.

### Ford's Project Management :
+ Integrates Lean methodologies with rigid Waterfall scheduling for large-scale vehicle production.
+ Employs the Global Product Development System (GPDS), which integrates product development and manufacturing processes.
+ Scheduling is aligned with specific vehicle program milestones.

### General Motors (GM):
+ Uses Agile and Lean hybrid models to reduce time-to-market, particularly for connected vehicles.
+ Utilizes the Global Vehicle Development Process (GVDP), which emphasizes early integration of engineering, design, and manufacturing.
+ Scheduling is structured around key decision points and gateways.

### Volkswagen:
+ Focuses on iterative improvements in their scheduling with Agile methodologies, particularly in cybersecurity for autonomous vehicles.
+ Implements the Modular Transverse Toolkit (MQB) strategy, which standardizes certain vehicle components across models.
+ Project scheduling focuses on coordinating development across multiple vehicle platforms.


## Balance Schedule, Scope, Budget & Quality
“Iron Triangle”: Balancing time, scope, and resources while maintaining high quality.

+ Key Considerations:
  + Schedule changes impact cost and scope.
  + Regulatory requirements (ISO/SAE 21434, UNECE WP.29) can cause schedule delays due to security compliance needs.
+ Mitigation Strategies:
  + Include buffer time for compliance and testing phases.
  + Prioritize tasks based on risk assessments and cybersecurity urgency.


## Risk-Managed Schedule

+ Risk Factors:
  + Legal: Delays due to compliance failures.
  + Technical: Emergence of new cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
  + Compliance: Adjustments to project schedule due to regulatory updates.
+ Risk Mitigation:
  + Allocate time for unexpected regulatory or technical risks.
  + Continuously monitor compliance checkpoints.



## Tools

+ Project Management Software:
  + MS Project: Great for detailed, Waterfall-style planning.
  + Jira: Preferred for Agile teams managing sprints and iterative development.
  + Trello: Useful for visual task management in smaller teams. 
+ Collaboration Tools:
  + Teams: For real-time communication.
  + Confluence: For documentation and progress tracking.
  + Automotive-specific tools: e.g., PTC Windchill for managing complex product schedules.



## Practical Application

+ Scenario:
  + Simulate scheduling for an automobility cybersecurity project.
  Task:
  + Develop a project schedule considering both Waterfall and Agile methods.
+ Requirements:
  + Factor in compliance with ISO/SAE 21434, UNECE WP.29. Tools:
  + Use MS Project or Jira to create and adjust the schedule.


## Requirements Management Significance 

+ Effective project scheduling is critical for:
  + Ensuring cybersecurity measures are integrated throughout the vehicle development process.
  + Coordinating security testing and validation activities.
  + Managing resource allocation for cybersecurity tasks.
  + Aligning cybersecurity efforts with regulatory compliance timelines.
  + Facilitating collaboration between cybersecurity teams and other project stakeholders.

Incorporating these elements into project scheduling, automobility cybersecurity professionals can better manage the complex interplay between development timelines, security requirements, and regulatory compliance in the rapidly evolving automotive industry.

## Summary
+ Project scheduling is essential to manage the complexity of automobility cybersecurity.
+ Different methodologies (Waterfall, Agile) apply to different phases and types of projects.
+ Automotive project management models integrate scheduling best practices.
+ Regulatory frameworks (ISO/SAE 21434, UNECE WP.29) directly impact project timelines.

Next Steps: Apply scheduling techniques in a case study scenario.
