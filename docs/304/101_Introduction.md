## 5 Key Cybersecurity Concerns

### 1. Remote Access Vulnerabilities

**Scenario**: A vehicle’s infotainment system, connected to the internet, is hacked, allowing an attacker to gain remote access to the car's critical functions, such as steering, brakes, or engine control.

**Potential Impact**: Hackers could manipulate the car’s driving system, potentially causing accidents, or lock the driver out of the vehicle.

**Mitigation**:

- Implement strong encryption for communication between the vehicle’s systems and external networks.
- Conduct regular security testing to identify vulnerabilities in remote access points.
- Deploy intrusion detection systems to monitor unusual activity.

### 2. Insecure Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates

**Scenario**: The car manufacturer sends OTA updates to improve vehicle software, but these updates are intercepted and tampered with by cybercriminals.

**Potential Impact**: A malicious actor could inject malware or disable critical vehicle systems, making the vehicle unsafe to operate.

**Mitigation**:

- Use cryptographic signing to verify the integrity and authenticity of updates.
- Establish a secure update process with multi-factor authentication to ensure that only authorized personnel can push updates.
- Include a rollback feature to revert to the previous version if an update is compromised.
