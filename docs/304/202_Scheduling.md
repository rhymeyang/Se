# Project Scheduling (2)

## Project Scope

- A project scope refers to the detailed description of the project’s deliverables, boundaries, and goals.
- Clearly defining scope ensures all stakeholders are aligned, prevents “scope creep”, and sets measurable objectives for the project.
- Critical in determining what parts of the automotive system (hardware, software, networks) will be secured and how regulatory compliance (ISO/SAE 21434, UNECE WP.29) will be maintained.

## Project Scope

- Focus on protecting automotive systems from cyber threats.
- Include both pre-launch (development phase) and post-launch (monitoring, updates) security.
- Objectives:
  - Compliance: Adhere to regulatory standards (ISO/SAE 21434, UNECE WP.29).
  - Risk Mitigation: Identify and mitigate cybersecurity risks throughout the vehicle lifecycle.
  - Security by Design: Embed cybersecurity measures during vehicle development.
  - Post-Launch Protection: Ensure mechanisms are in place for ongoing cybersecurity monitoring and patching.

## Project Scope

- Scenario: **Atat Motors**, an automotive company, is developing a new connected electric vehicle (EV) that will be launched in 18 months. The vehicle must comply with ISO/SAE 21434, UNECE WP.29, and other cybersecurity regulations.
- The task is to define the cybersecurity scope and objectives for this project.
- Key Stakeholders:
  - Automotive engineers
  - Software developers
  - Compliance officers
  - Third-party cybersecurity auditors

## Steps to Define Project Scope

1. Understand the Project’s Requirements:
   - Review cybersecurity standards (e.g., ISO/SAE 21434) and regulations (e.g., UNECE WP.29).
   - Identify key security requirements based on connected vehicle technology.
2. Define What’s Included in the Scope:
   - Specify components of the vehicle that require cybersecurity (ECUs, infotainment systems, sensors, etc.).
   - Include both hardware and software security requirements.
3. Identify What’s Not Included:
   - Clearly outline what is outside the project’s scope to avoid confusion (e.g., non-digital components, unrelated subsystems).
4. Determine Success Criteria:

- Establish measurable cybersecurity goals (e.g., passed vulnerability tests, compliance certifications).

## Example Scope Definition

Included:

1. Secure software development lifecycle for in-vehicle systems.
2. Penetration testing of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications.
3. Compliance with ISO/SAE 21434 cybersecurity requirements.
4. Integration of over-the-air (OTA) security patching systems.

Not Included:

1. Development of non-digital vehicle systems.
2. Cybersecurity for third-party aftermarket devices not provided by the manufacturer.

## Developing Project Objectives

1. Clear, Measurable Goals: Ensure that the objectives are well-defined, time- bound, and linked to specific outcomes (e.g., complete security testing of all in-vehicle systems within 12 months).
2. Alignment with Business Goals: Ensure cybersecurity objectives support the company's broader business objectives, such as market launch timelines and regulatory compliance.
3. Risk Management: Include objectives that focus on mitigating cybersecurity risks (e.g., implement security controls for V2X communications).
4. Regulatory Compliance: Ensure all cybersecurity objectives meet regulatory standards (e.g., “Achieve ISO/SAE 21434 compliance by Q4 of the project”).

## SMART Objectives

- **Specific**: “Secure the infotainment system, communication protocols, and software updates.”
- **Measurable**: “Achieve 100% compliance with ISO/SAE 21434 within 12 months.”
- **Achievable**: “Allocate resources to ensure all security testing is completed on time.”
- **Relevant**: “Align with regulatory needs and business goals of secure vehicle launch.”
- **Time-bound**: “Complete system security testing by the end of Q3.”

## Aligning Scope with Compliance

- ISO/SAE 21434:
  - Requires cybersecurity to be integrated across the entire product lifecycle.
  - Ensure that the project scope includes both development and post- launch cybersecurity measures.
- UNECE WP.29:
  - Mandates cybersecurity management in vehicle types - align objectives with compliance review stages.

## Scope Creep

- What is Scope Creep?: Uncontrolled expansion to project scope without adjustments to time, cost, and resources.
- Impact in Automotive Cybersecurity:
  - Adding new cybersecurity features or testing requirements without revisiting timelines can delay project launch.
- How to Prevent It:
  - Clearly define the initial scope and objectives.
  - Establish a process for evaluating changes to scope.
  - Regularly review scope in project meetings and adjust resources as needed.

Title: Cybersecurity Assignment for a Connected Vehicle System

**Scenario Overview:**

- A large automaker (e.g., "Future Motors") is developing a new electric vehicle (EV) that requires robust cybersecurity measures.
- The automaker needs to ensure compliance with ISO/SAE 21434 and UNECE WP.29 standards throughout the project lifecycle.
- You are tasked with scheduling the cybersecurity elements of the project while balancing the project’s time, scope, budget, and quality.

## Assignment 1 (5%)

Defining the Project Scope and Objectives (1)

Goal: Ensure that the vehicle’s system is secure by the time of launch, adhering to industry standards and regulations.

Key Deliverables:

- Security assessments at each phase (design, implementation, testing, and deployment).
- Regular compliance reviews with ISO/SAE 21434 and UNECE WP.29.
- Ongoing monitoring and updates for post-launch cybersecurity issues.

## Assignment 1 (5%)

- Define the project scope using requirements from the fictional automaker and cybersecurity regulations.
- Use a tool like MS Word or Confluence to create a project scope document.
- Incorporate cybersecurity objectives, compliance requirements, and stakeholder expectations.

Break Down Project Phases (2)

Project Phases (aligned with both Waterfall and Agile approaches):

1. Requirement Gathering: Collect all requirements related to cybersecurity, both from technical (software, hardware) and regulatory (ISO/SAE 21434) perspectives.
2. Design: Plan and architect the cybersecurity defenses.
3. Development: Build the security features.
4. Testing: Implement penetration tests, vulnerability assessments.
5. Deployment: Final rollout with ongoing monitoring.
6. Post-Launch Monitoring: Schedule updates and monitoring for regulatory compliance post-launch.

## Assignment 1 (5%)

Task 2

- Create a “high-level” Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for the cybersecurity project, outlining key tasks and sub-tasks for each phase.
- Use tools like Trello or Jira to visually map the WBS.

Develop the Initial Project Schedule (3)

Create a Project Timeline:

- Establish the duration of each phase (e.g., Requirement Gathering – 2 weeks, Design – 4 weeks, etc.).
- Consider external factors like regulatory review times and potential delays in testing.

## Assignment 1 (5%)

Task 3

- Using MS Project, create a Gantt chart that outlines the timeline for each phase of the cybersecurity project.
- Include start/end dates, dependencies between tasks, and milestones (e.g., "Completion of Security Testing").

Apply Waterfall and Agile Methodologies (4)

Waterfall Approach:

- Sequentially plan the project’s phases and schedule, with defined start and finish dates for each.
- Minimal room for adjustments once phases are underway.
