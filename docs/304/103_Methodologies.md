## Agenda

- Project Lifecycle Phases
- Project Management Models
- Recap of Project Management
- Review of PMBOK and Agile
- Waterfall vs. Agile methodologies
- Tailoring Methodologies
- Discussion / Case Study

## Key Points

- Importance of structured frameworks for managing complex cybersecurity projects in automobility.
- Comparison of Waterfall and Agile methodologies, and how these models can be tailored for automobility cybersecurity.

## Project Lifecycle Phases

- **Initiation**: Define project scope, objectives, and initial risk assessments.
- **Planning**: Establish cybersecurity protocols, define roles, and tailor the methodology to address specific security challenges.
- **Execution**: Implement project activities, regularly test for security vulnerabilities, and adjust as needed.
- **Monitoring and Controlling**: Continuous tracking of project progress, cybersecurity incidents, and changes in scope.
- **Closure**: Conduct final security reviews, audits, and post-project analysis to capture lessons learned.

## Recap of Project Management

- **Toyota's 3M Model (Muda, Mura, Muri)**: Focus on reducing waste, variation, and strain through Lean principles. Enhances security and efficiency in projects.
- **Ford’s Product Development Process (FPDS)**: Structured and stage-gate model emphasizing innovation and quality control, often aligned with Waterfall methodology.
- **Volkswagen's Agile Development**: More focus on agile processes for software development, embracing flexibility and responsiveness to changes.

## Review of PMBOK and Agile

- PMBOK in Cybersecurity:
  - **Emphasizes structured stages**: Initiation, Planning, Execution, Monitoring & Controlling, and Closing.
  - **Key Processes**: Scope Management, Risk Management, Quality Control.
- Agile Methodologies in Cybersecurity:
  - **Flexibility**: Respond quickly to emerging security threats.
  - **Scrum and Kanban**: Useful in sprints for testing and deploying cybersecurity measures.
- **When to Choose Agile or Waterfall**: Potential hybrid models for automobility.

## Waterfall Methodology

Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next starts.

Phases:

+ → **Requirements**
+ → **Design**
+ → **Development**
+ → **Testing**
+ → **Deployment**
+ → **Maintenance**

---
**Pros**:

- Clearly defined stages and milestones.
- Easier to manage large teams and long-term projects.
- Suitable for projects with fixed requirements.

**Cons**:

- Inflexible: Difficult to adapt to changes.
- Testing and security checks occur late in the process, which can delay response to cybersecurity risks.

## Agile Methodology

An iterative, flexible approach where project development happens in cycles (sprints).

**Key Concepts**:

- **Sprints**: Short, time-boxed development cycles.
- **Scrum framework**: Daily standups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives.
- **Kanban**: Visualizing workflows to improve process efficiency.

**Pros**:

- Highly adaptable to changing requirements and new cybersecurity threats.
- Encourages continuous collaboration between stakeholders and team members.
- Continuous testing and updates ensure early identification of security risks.

**Cons**:

- Can be chaotic if not well-managed.
- May lead to “scope creep” without proper controls.
- Less suitable for projects with strict regulatory or compliance requirements, common in the automotive industry.

## Waterfall vs Agile

**Waterfall**:

- Best suited for large, complex, and compliance-driven projects.
- Works well when requirements are static and clearly defined from the outset.
- Cybersecurity integration happens in later stages, potentially leaving gaps early in the project.

**Agile**:

- Ideal for dynamic environments where cybersecurity threats evolve rapidly.
- Enables frequent testing, risk identification, and adjustments during development.
- Encourages iterative improvements but may lack clear documentation needed for regulatory approval.

## Tailoring Methodologies

**Waterfall for Regulatory Projects**: Tailor Waterfall to ensure compliance with standards like ISO/SAE 21434 and UNECE WP.29, where rigid documentation is necessary.

**Agile for Threat Response**: Use Agile for ongoing cybersecurity initiatives like software patches, vulnerability management, and incident response.

**Hybrid Models**: Some automobility projects might benefit from a hybrid approach (combining Waterfall and Agile), where fixed stages like compliance testing (Waterfall) coexist with iterative software development (Agile).

## Discussion

- When is Waterfall more appropriate for automobility cybersecurity projects?
- In what scenarios does Agile excel for cybersecurity challenges?
- Can both methodologies be combined for optimal results? How would that work in practice?
- What challenges might a project manager face when transitioning between Waterfall and Agile?

## Case Study

**Scenario**: A connected vehicle platform requires regular security patches, while also needing to comply with stringent automotive regulations.

**Waterfall Approach**: Review how a Waterfall approach might structure long-term compliance planning and project execution.

**Agile Approach**: Explore how Agile sprints would handle continuous security monitoring, threat assessments, and response to emerging vulnerabilities.

**Activity**: Discuss each approach, and present which methodology (or hybrid) would be most effective for the project.

## Summary / Key Takeaways

- Both Waterfall and Agile have their place in managing automobility cybersecurity projects.
- Waterfall excels in structured, regulatory-heavy environments but lacks flexibility.
- Agile is dynamic and allows for quick adaptation to cybersecurity threats but may lack the control needed for complex compliance.
- Tailoring methodologies to specific project needs is critical, and hybrid models may offer the best of both worlds.
