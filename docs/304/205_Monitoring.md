## Overview of Project Monitoring and Controlling

2.5.7 MONITORING NEW WORK AND CHANGES

- _“In adaptive projects, there is an expectation that work will evolve and adapt. As a result, new work can be added to the product backlog, as needed. However, if more work is added than is being completed, or if the same amount of work is added that is being completed, the project will continue without end._ **\*The project manager works with the product owner to manage expectations around adding scope, the implications to the budget, and the availability of project team members\*\***. The product owner prioritizes the project backlog on an ongoing basis so that high-priority items are completed. If the schedule or budget is constrained, the product owner may consider the project done when the highest priority items are delivered”.\*

- Risk Matrices: Assess and prioritize risks (align with ISO 31000).

## Tools for Monitoring and Controlling

- Earned Value Management (EVM) is a project management technique that integrates cost, schedule, and scope to assess project performance and progress.
- By comparing the amount of work planned with the work completed and the costs incurred, EVM helps project managers make data-driven decisions to keep the project on track.
- EVM provides valuable insights into project health by calculating performance indices and variances that signal whether the project is ahead, on schedule, or behind in terms of time and budget.

## Earned Value Management (EVM)

- An EVM is a project management technique that integrates cost, schedule, and scope to assess project performance and progress.
- By comparing the amount of work planned with the work completed and the costs incurred, EVM helps project managers make data-driven decisions to keep the project on track.
- EVM provides valuable insights into project health by calculating performance indices and variances that signal whether the project is ahead, on schedule, or behind in terms of time and budget.

## Earned Value Management (EVM)

To develop an EVM system, start with the following steps:

1. Define Project Scope and Create a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):
   - Break down the project scope into smaller, manageable work packages in a WBS, ensuring that each task or deliverable is well-defined and measurable.
2. Estimate Costs for Each Task:
   - Assign budgeted costs (or Budget at Completion, BAC) for each work package. These costs represent the total planned value for the work.
3. Establish a Project Schedule:
   - Develop a project timeline, identifying start and end dates for each work package. This schedule serves as the baseline for tracking progress.
4. Set Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB):
   - The PMB is the combined baseline for scope, schedule, and cost, against which project performance will be measured. It includes Planned Value (PV), Earned Value (EV), and Actual Cost (AC).
5. Plan Reporting Periods and Collect Data:
   - Set intervals for reviewing project performance (e.g., weekly or monthly) and gather data at each reporting period to analyze progress.

## Earned Value Management (EVM)

Key Metrics:

1. Budget at Completion (BAC):
   - The total budgeted amount for the entire project.
2. Planned Value (PV):
   - The amount of work scheduled to be completed at a specific time. Also known as the Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS).
3. Earned Value (EV):
   - The value of the work actually completed by the specified time. Also known as Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP).
4. Actual Cost (AC):
   - The actual costs incurred for the work performed by the specified time, also called the Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP).

## Calculate Planned Value (PV)

To calculate Planned Value (PV), take the percentage of the project that was planned to be completed by a certain date and multiply it by the project’s total budget (BAC).

For example, if a project’s BAC is $100,000 and you expected to be 40% complete by a specific date, then:

**PV= 40% ×100,000 = 40,000**

This tells you that, by that date, you should have completed $40,000 worth of work according to the project schedule.

## Calculate Earned Value (EV)

To calculate Earned Value (EV), take the percentage of the project that has actually been completed by a certain date and multiply it by the project’s total budget (BAC).

For example, if a project’s BAC is $100,000 and you expected to be 35% complete by a specific date, then:

**EV= 35% ×100,000 = 35,000**

This tells you that, as of this point in the project, you’ve completed $35,000 worth of the total budgeted work.

## Calculate Actual Value (AV)

This is the actual cost incurred for the work completed by a specific time.

There is no formula to calculate Actual Value (AV) because it is based on actual expenditure data collected from the project.

## Calculating EVM Metrics

Cost Variance (CV):

- Measures cost efficiency by comparing Earned Value (EV) and Actual Cost (AC).
- Formula: **CV = EV − AC**
- Interpretation: `If CV > 0`, the project is under budget; `if CV < 0`, the project is over budget.

---

Schedule Variance (SV):

Measures schedule efficiency by comparing Earned Value (EV) and Planned Value (PV).

Formula: **SV = EV − PV**

Interpretation: `If SV > 0`, the project is ahead of schedule; `if SV < 0`, the project is behind schedule.

---

Cost Performance Index (CPI):

Indicates cost efficiency by showing the ratio of EV to AC.

Formula: **CPI = EV / AC**

Interpretation: **CPI** > 1 means the project is cost-efficient; **CPI** < 1 indicates cost overruns.

---

Schedule Performance Index (SPI):

Indicates schedule efficiency by showing the ratio of EV to PV.

Formula: **SPI = EV / PV**

Interpretation: **SPI** > 1 means the project is ahead of schedule; **SPI** < 1 means it’s behind schedule.

---

Estimate at Completion (EAC):

Forecasts the total cost of the project at completion, based on current cost performance.

Formula: **EAC = BAC / CPI**

---

Estimate to Complete (ETC):

Estimates the remaining cost to finish the project.

Formula: **ETC = EAC − AC**

## Evaluating EVM Results

Once EVM metrics are calculated, they provide insights into the project’s current status and future performance:

- **Cost Analysis**: Examine **CPI** to determine if cost efficiencies are being achieved. Consistently low CPI suggests budget issues, prompting the need for cost-cutting or reassessment of project resources.
- **Schedule Analysis**: Use **SPI** and **SV** to assess if the project is on schedule. If SPI remains low over several periods, adjustments to the timeline or resource allocation may be necessary.
- **Trend Analysis**: Track **CPI** and **SPI** over time to understand project trends. Improvement or deterioration in these indices can help predict project health and guide corrective actions.
- **Forecast Accuracy**: Regularly update **EAC** and **ETC** to provide realistic estimates based on current performance trends, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions.

## Example Scenario 3

Suppose a project has a BAC of $100,000, with the following data collected at a specific reporting period:

- Planned Value (PV): $40,000
- Earned Value (EV): $35,000
- Actual Cost (AC): $30,000

## Example Scenario 4

Calculate and interpret:

- **CV = 35,000 − 30,000 = +5,000** (under budget)
- **SV = 35,000 − 40,000 = −5,000** (behind schedule)
- **CPI = 35,000 / 30,000 = 1.17** (efficient use of costs)
- **SPI = 35,000 / 40,000 = 0.875** (project is behind schedule)

This analysis shows that while the project is currently under budget, it is lagging in terms of schedule, highlighting the need for schedule adjustments to meet the timeline.

## Monitoring and Controlling in Waterfall

     - At the end of the project, the CPI is 1.02 (indicating cost efficiency) and SPI is 1.0 (indicating the project finished on schedule).
     - Compliance with ISO/SAE 21434 standards is verified, and stakeholders approve the final deployment, noting satisfaction with the adherence to budget and timeline.

## Monitoring and Controlling in Agile

- Agile Approach:
  - Iterative process with frequent check-ins (sprints and retrospectives).
  - Emphasis on adaptability and constant feedback loops
- Project management is iterative, with work divided into cycles or “sprints” allowing for regular feedback and adjustments.
- Monitoring and controlling focuses on tracking progress, quality, and adaptability in each sprint, ensuring alignment with evolving requirements and stakeholder feedback.
- Example Scenario
  - Imagine an Agile project to develop a mobile app for in-car diagnostics in an automotive cybersecurity context. The project is budgeted at $150,000 and will be developed over six two-week sprints.
