+ Security by Design: Emphasizes the integration of cybersecurity from the earliest stages of vehicle development, known as “security by design.”
+ Continuous Monitoring and Updating: Cybersecurity does not end after production. The standard stresses the need for ongoing security monitoring, updates (e.g., over-the-air patches), and incident response capabilities.

## ISO/SEA 21434 – Life Cycle Phases
Ensures embedding cybersecurity into the entire vehicle lifecycle: 

### Concept Phase
+ Goal: Identify and assess cybersecurity risks and threats during the initial concept stage.
+ Activities:
  + Threat analysis and risk assessment (TARA).
  + Identification of critical assets and systems.

### Development Phase

## ISO/SEA 21434 – Risk Management
+ Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA):
  + Core to the standard is conducting TARA to evaluate potential cybersecurity risks.
  + It involves identifying potential vulnerabilities, assessing their impact, and defining risk mitigation strategies.
+ Risk Treatment:
  + Once risks are identified, manufacturers must prioritize and implement measures
to address the most critical vulnerabilities.
  + The standard recommends the use of cryptography, authentication, and intrusion detection systems to enhance vehicle security.

## ISO/SEA 21434 – Security Measures
+ Doesn’t just focus on vehicle-level security but also mandates cybersecurity practices at the organizational level:
+ Cybersecurity Governance: Organizations must establish cybersecurity policies, governance structures, and roles within the company to ensure accountability.
+ Supply Chain Security: Since many components are sourced from third-party suppliers, ISO/SAE 21434 requires strict cybersecurity standards and contracts for suppliers to ensure the whole supply chain is secure.
+ Awareness and Training: Continuous education and training programs for staff are emphasized to ensure all team members are aware of and contribute to cybersecurity efforts.

## ISO/SEA 21434 - Implementation
+ Example 1: Implementing secure software development practices in electric and autonomous vehicles to prevent remote hacking of ECUs.
+ Example 2: Conducting regular over-the-air (OTA) updates for connected vehicles to patch vulnerabilities identified in post- production.
+ Example 3: Using TARA to evaluate risks for in-vehicle infotainment systems and designing defenses to mitigate them.

## UNECE WP.29 – Compliance
WP.29 requires vehicle manufacturers to implement and maintain both CSMS and SUMS to comply with cybersecurity and software update regulations.
Key compliance requirements include: 

### Documentation and Certification
– Manufacturers must maintain detailed documentation of their cybersecurity and software management practices.
– They must demonstrate compliance through certification from relevant authorities, such as type-approval authorities in participating countries (e.g., the European Union).
– Certifications must be periodically reviewed and updated as part of an ongoing compliance process.

### Ongoing Monitoring and Risk Management
– Cybersecurity is not a one-time implementation but requires continuous monitoring of the vehicle’s ecosystem to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
– Manufacturers must have processes in place for threat detection, incident reporting, and vulnerability management.

## UNECE WP.29 – Impact
WP.29 is recognized by over 60 countries, including the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and others, making it a globally harmonized framework for vehicle regulations.
Harmonization with ISO/SAE 21434: WP.29 regulations work in tandem with the ISO/SAE 21434 standard to provide a unified approach to automotive cybersecurity.
While ISO/SAE 21434 defines the technical framework for cybersecurity, WP.29 outlines the regulatory and compliance aspects.
