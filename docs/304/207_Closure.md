# Project Closure

## Project Closure

Definition:

- Project Closure is the final stage of the project lifecycle in which a project is formally completed and handed over.
- It involves finalizing all project activities, ensuring that objectives have been met, lessons learned are documented, and resources are released.
- The goal is to confirm that the project has achieved its scope and quality requirements within the defined constraints.

## Project Closure (PMBOK)

- Project Closure is the final phase of the project lifecycle, as defined in the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK).
- It is a critical stage that formally concludes all project activities, ensuring that all deliverables are completed, accepted, and transitioned appropriately.
- PMBOK's Structured Stage
  - Project Closure is part of the Closing Process Group, the last of the five process groups.
  - Consists of processes performed to formally complete or close a project, phase, or contract.
  - Often overlooked but has significant impact on the organization's future due to the documentation of lessons learned and storage of reports for future reference.

---

- Key Components:
  - Formal Acceptance: Gaining sign-off from stakeholders.
  - Final Deliverables: Ensuring all deliverables meet quality and contractual requirements.
  - Documentation: Archiving project records for future reference.
  - Lessons Learned: Facilitating post-mortem meetings to improve future projects.
  - Release of Resources: Freeing project team members and assets.

## Regulatory Compliance

- ISO/SAE 21434
  - This standard for cybersecurity in road vehicles requires that project closure includes comprehensive security validation and documentation.
  - The closure process must ensure that all cybersecurity requirements have been met, and that proper handover of security-related information occurs.
- UNECE WP.29
  - These regulations mandate a Cybersecurity Management System (CSMS) for vehicle manufacturers.
  - Project closure under WP.29 must include verification that all cybersecurity measures are in place and that the vehicle type approval process is complete.
- ISO 31000
  - This risk management standard influences project closure by requiring a final risk assessment and documentation of risk management strategies implemented throughout the project lifecycle.

## Agile v. Waterfall Methodologies

- Waterfall Methodology
  - Project Closure is a distinct, rigidly defined, final phase that occurs after all other phases are complete.
  - Involves sequential verification of deliverables.
  - Involves formal sign-offs, comprehensive documentation, and a clear handover process.
- Agile Methodology
  - Agile projects have a more iterative approach to closure. While there is still a final closure phase, many closure activities may occur throughout the project at the end of each sprint or iteration.
  - Focus is on delivering incremental value.
  - The final closure in Agile focuses more on retrospectives and continuous improvement.

## Automotive Project Management Models

- Toyota
  - Uses the Toyota Production System (TPS), which emphasizes Lean principles and continuous improvement (_Kaizen_ 改善).
  - Project closure in TPS involves extensive analysis of lessons learned and future process improvements.
- Ford
  - Employs the Global Product Development System (GPDS), incorporating stage-gated reviews for product lifecycle phases, including project closure.
  - Closure in GPDS would align with specific vehicle program milestones and include formal handovers to production teams.
- General Motors:
  - Utilizes the Global Vehicle Development Process (GVDP).
  - Emphasizes documentation and lessons learned during closure.
  - Closure in GVDP would involve final quality checks and transition to manufacturing.

## Scenario 1: Cybersecurity Risk Mitigation

- A leading EV manufacturer undertakes a project to implement cybersecurity measures for over-the-air (OTA) software updates.
- During the project closure phase, the team ensured all deliverables met ISO/SAE 21434 standards.
- Key Activities in Project Closure:
  - Conducted a final compliance audit against UNECE WP.29.
  - Prepared cybersecurity assurance reports for homologation authorities.
  - Facilitated a lessons learned session, identifying gaps in early threat modeling phases.
  - Created a knowledge repository to improve future cybersecurity engineering efforts.
- Outcome:
  - The project achieved full regulatory compliance and provided valuable insights into managing third-party risks in the supply chain.

## Scenario 2: Supply Chain Security Management

- A project at a multinational automaker aimed to strengthen supply chain security by incorporating ISO 31000 risk management practices.
- Key Activities in Project Closure:
  - Compiled a risk assessment report, focusing on Tier 1 and Tier 2 supplier vulnerabilities.
  - Conducted a final retrospective to evaluate the integration of Agile sprints in supply chain risk management.
  - Finalized contractual agreements with suppliers to include cybersecurity compliance clauses.
- Outcome:
  - The project closure ensured seamless integration of risk controls, boosting supplier accountability and setting a precedent for future collaborations.

## Scenario 3: Cross-functional Collaboration

- A cross-functional team has managed a project to develop a cybersecurity framework for connected vehicles.
- Key Activities in Project Closure:
  - Created a project summary report detailing the framework's alignment with UNECE WP.29 and ISO/SAE 21434.
  - Conducted a review session to identify continuous improvement opportunities.
  - Hosted a project handover workshop for operational teams, ensuring effective transition.
- Outcome:
  - The structured closure process minimized operational disruptions and strengthened inter-departmental collaboration.
