## Comprehensive Automobility Cybersecurity Strategy – Phase 1 - Proposal

Weightage: 10%

Due Date: 5th February 2025

---

As your final semester project, you will design and deliver a challenging, industry-relevant automobility cybersecurity strategy. This project will require you to apply advanced technical skills, strategic thinking, and domain-specific knowledge to address real-world challenges in the automobility sector.

By the end of this project, you will have developed a professional-grade strategy that demonstrates your readiness for cybersecurity roles in the industry.

Each phase of the project will be designed to reflect the complexity and expectations of the cybersecurity domain, integrating Canadian policy and regulatory frameworks, international standards, and emerging industry trends.

### Project Scope and Requirements

Goal:
To create a comprehensive automobility cybersecurity strategy that:

- Aligns with Transport Canada’s policies and regulatory frameworks.
- Addresses modern Canadian and international standards for cybersecurity.
- Tackles real-world challenges such as V2X communications, risk management, and privacy concerns.

This project is divided into four technical phases. Each phase contributes 10% weightage to your final grade.

### Phase 1: Policy Analysis and Proposal Development (10%)

- **Objective**: Define the foundation of your cybersecurity strategy by analyzing key policies and presenting a detailed project proposal.
- Project Requirements:
  1. Policy Research Report:
     - Investigate Canadian automobility cybersecurity frameworks, including those from Transport Canada
     - Compare and contrast emerging international standards such as ISO/SAE 21434 and WP.29.
     - Examine nonregulatory guidance, tools, and best practices used globally.
  2. Proposal Document:
     - Define the scope, objectives, and major findings of your strategy.
     - Outline how your strategy will address governance, risk, and compliance (GRC), including high-value assets (HVAs) and critical systems.
     - Proposals must be technical, structured, and solution-focused to gain approval before Phase 2 begins.
  3. Review and Approval:
     - Present your proposal to the faculty for approval
     - Feedback will guide the next phases.
