# Develop a Project Plan

## Project planning overview

identifies the works must be done.

break the work down to make it easy to manage.

once have tasks list, then decide:

- Who?
- Estimated time?
- Estimated cost?

### Project Plan

- Used over the course of the project
- Directs people's tasks
- Tracks project's progression
- Aids in course corrections
- Communicates progress with stakeholders

## Work Breakdown Structure(WBS)

![image-20240528233314184](/images/pm/03_01.jpg)

- Easier to estimate time and cost.
- Easier to assign work.

![image-20240528233504839](/images/pm/03_02.jpg)

- WBS(two type of tasks)
  - Summary tasks
    - Higher-level tasks in WBS
    - The quantity of levels depends on project complexity
  - Work packages
    - Lowest level in WBS

## Build a work Breakdown structure

### Work Packages

- Break down in eight-to-eighty-hour tasks
- Match to frequency of status reports

### Determining Breakdowns

- Time and cost are easy to estimate
- Status is easy to measure
- Task durations are shorter than reporting periods
- Details are manageable

## How to create work packages

- Defining work packages
- Create work package documents

### Level of Detail

- Familiarity of work
- Experience of the team member

## Estimate time and cost

- Core planning team
- Team members

### Parametric Model

Calculate work and cost based on a measured unit.

### Delphi Technique

For large project, Top-Down estimate works well.

## How to choose the best estimate

Choosing Estimate Values

### Adjust your Estimate

- A highter value increases the chance of success
- A lower value decreases the chance of success

Choose the estimate with an acceptable probability of success

## Create a resource management plan

- Roles
- Responsibilities
- Reporting structure
- Skills
- Staffing

### RICA

- **R**esponsible for doing
- Needs to be **I**nformed
- **C**onsult before a decision
- **A**ccountable for decisions and delegatioins

### Staffing Plan

- Identify sources for resources
- When are they needed
- Training requirements
- Resource processes

## Build a project schedule

1. Put tasks in sequential order
2. Estimate the time each task will take.
3. Assign tasks to project team members
4. Calculate task duration
5. Account for deadlines and other constrains.

## Develop a project budget

- Labor
  - Vendors
  - Contractors
  - Employees
- System
- Other(travel)
- Contingency
- Total

### Burdened Cost

For Employees

- Salary
- Benefits

### Time-Based Resources

- Rental equipment
- Leased office space

### Materials

- Equipment being installed
- Construction materials
- Consumable goods

### Ancillary

- Travel
- Training
- Fees

Assign resources and other costs to the tasks in your project schedule.

### Money Allocated

If estimate is high:

- Eliminate nonessential expenses
- Use less expensive resources
- Cut scope

## Identify risks

### Known Unknows

- Weather delays
- Unavailable resources
  - Technology
  - Time Zone
  - relationship
  - deliverables
  - limited options
- Unknown unknows
  - unforeseeable events
  - contingency funds (应急费用)

some 15% according to experience, and depends on situation



Ch03-Risk Information Form Template.docx

create rish information sheet


## Create a risk management plan

### Evaluate Rish
+ How likely?
+ How serious?

|             |       |          |        |
| ----------- | ----- | -------- | ------ |
| Probability | 1 low | 3 medium | 5 high |
| Impact      | 1 low | 3 medium | 5 high |

+ Unlikely and not serious  `1 x 1 = 1`
+ Medium likely and serious `3 x 3 = 9`
+ Very likely and serious `5 x 5 = 25`

### Avoid Rish

+ Changing project scope

### Mitigate Rish

+ Reducing impact

### Transfer Risk

+ Handing risk to someone else

---

+ Your response to the risk should reflect the impact of the risk.
+ Review and update the risk management plan regularly

## Set up a communication plan

+ identify your audiences(who should know)
+ Who, What, How
  + Who - management
    + What - objective
    + How - Project plan, Status reports, Expenditures, Closeout report
  + Who - Sponsor
    + What - Objective
    + How - Weekly 1:1
  + Who - Functional managers
    + What - Skill sets, Milestones, Constraints, Schedules
    + How - Bi-weekly email
  + Who - Team
    + What - Assignments, Upcoming tasks, Changes, Best Practices
    + How - Weekly emails

### Communication Distribution

+ Frequency
+ Fromat (face to face, email)

### Quality

+ Meeting customer's requirements on time and within budget
+ Conforming deliverables to specifications



![image-20241029004337095](/images/pm/03_11.png)

+ Quality Standard(can't be lower)
+ Longer scheduling Increased cost(can't be higher)

### Quality Assurance Plan

Processes needed to meet quality standards

### Quality Control

Measure and monitor quality of final deliverables

+ Acceptance test
+ Inspection
+ Peer review
+ Walk-through
+ Audit

Tools for quality improvement
