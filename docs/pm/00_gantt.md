## Gantt Charts

### Critical Path

The longest sequence of activities in a project that must be completed to be on time.

### Slippage

What has actually happened compared with what should have happened.

- What if there are two critical paths?
- What if you have tasks that you want to overlap?

### Granulate a Task

Cut it into smaller parts.

### Task Link

- Finish - Start
- Start - Start
- Finish - Finish
- Start - Finish

- Spread the contingency through your critical path, adding a little bit to each task.
  - Network Diagram - Gantt Charts
- Risks in Your Gantt Chart
  - If there are much 1 day work, it will never happen in real world
  - If floating task nearly critical, should pay attention
  - Too much short tasks at the end(need to add time)

### Granularity

The degree to which tasks are broken down

- Double-check the connections between tasks as you progress.
- Does the network diagram look right?

Check Your Plan

- Too many tasks? (30+)
- Any task larger than the others?
- Any flurry of small tasks at the end?
- A good mix of series and parallel?

### Putting in and positioning the floating tasks

Floating Tasks

- Add vertical lines
- Okay to share a float
- Floaters may depend on other floaters.
- Decide to float earlier or later
- Neater is easier to understand

### Assessing the software options

Microsofe Excel

- Sharing
- Adding up costs and time
- Planning resources for multiple projects

### How to leverage a Gantt Chart

Before I promise anything, I need to do a bit of planning, which I think you'll agree, is a reasonable thing to do.

Kickoff meeting

- See roles
- Commit to responsibilities

Verify Commitments

Two steps

- What we're going to plan
- sign off on the plan

### Using a Gantt chart to plan resources for one project

Units of Measure for Resource Plan

- Hours per week
- Person days per week or month
- Number of people(FTEs) per week/month

- Identify bottleneck resources
- Look at time and projects

### Monitoring progress with a Gantt chart

### Assessing risk with a Gantt Chart

Risk

- Lateness
- Overspend
  - consider the cost risks of **all tasks**

### Speeding up your project with Gantt Chart

Speed up: First Half

- Increase resources
- Reduce quality
- Overlap tasks

Crashing the Project

- Increase resources
- Reduce quality
- Overlap tasks

Speed up: Second Half

- Increase resources
- Reduce quality
- Overlap tasks
- Let it slip

> Only reschedule **once**.

**Ask for more** than a repeat of the first half.

### Forecasting spend with a Gantt chart

Predicting Spend

### Forecasting Challenge

**Forecast Cost at Completion(FCC)**

An estimate of the project's final cost

Challenge

- Estimate the final cost
- Predict the date of completion

### Forecasting Solution

Optimist View

Pessimist View

### Five common mistake

1. Jumping straight to the Gantt Chart
2. Getting the wrong level of granularity
3. Forgetting Contingency
4. Neglecting the Gantt chart once you've started
5. Changing your plan more than once
