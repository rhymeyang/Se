### Chapter 2 Solution

Project Management Foundations with Bonnie Biafore

#### **Scheduling project case study**

From the exercises, review the following information about the Brisland Hospital Scheduling Project: 

+ The scope statement from the movie Prepare a Project Scope Statement (Chapter 2)
+ The hospital organization chart from the Chapter 1 challenge

The movie Create a Project Charter makes recommendations about the contents of a Project Charter, including: 

+ The project manager’s authority
+ Support from the project sponsor

Answer the following questions about the project charter:

1. The project manager needs the authority and support from the sponsor to work with project stake- holders to deliver the following objectives from the scope statement:
   + Rescheduling procedures decreased by 75%
   + Software must run on all current computer platforms
   + Decrease average procedure wait time to less than 30 minutes
   + Reduce procedure errors by 50%

For each of these objectives, who do you believe the stakeholders are and why are those stakeholders critical to the project?

Let’s answer the question for these objectives one at a time.

##### Rescheduling procedures decreased by 75%

To ensure rescheduling procedures are decreased, facilities must be available to meet patient demand. This may require changing the available hours for procedure rooms and ensuring they are appropriately staffed during those hours.

Nicholas Anderson (VP General Services) and David Moore (Facilities) are the owners of the procedure rooms, so they will need to be consulted about availability, facility capacity, and the equipment used during procedures.

If staffing shortages cause reschedules, Dr. Samuel Tan (Physician Services) and Christina Garcia (Director of Nursing) would be needed to ensure the technicians, doctors, and nurses are available to reduce the rescheduling times and meet this project objective.

##### Software must run on all current computer platforms

Emily Weber (Director of IT) will need to be engaged to:

a. Ensure the current platforms do not change, or, if they change, that the scheduling software will run on the new platforms

b. Ensure the software is installed and maintained in the IT environment so the scheduling system operates properly

##### Decrease average procedure wait time to less than 30 minutes

Facility availability and capacity will be necessary to meet this objective, so Nicholas Anderson (VP General Services) and David Moore (Facilities) will need to be consulted about facility availability and capacity, and the equipment used during procedures.

In addition, staffing levels for technicians will need to be maintained by Dr. Samuel Tan (Physician Services) and Christina Garcia (Director of Nursing). Additional staff members might need training to administer procedures properly, which will require the engagement of Gabriele Costa, the Education and Training Manager.

##### Reduce procedure errors by 50%

In general, procedure errors are caused by two issues: instructions for administering procedures are not well written, or staff education is lacking. So, Gabriele Costa, the Education and Training Manager will need to be engaged to ensure training is appropriate, and Dr. Samuel Tan (Physician Services) and Christina Garcia (Director of Nursing) and their teams need to review current instructions for administering procedures.

2，What support from Dr. Olsen, the project sponsor, is required regarding staffing to appropriately utilize hospital facilities and meet the goal of decreasing the average procedure wait time to less than 30 minutes?

In addition to the support to work with required stakeholders, overall staff levels and funding for training may need to be increased. As the sponsor, Dr. Olsen’s support will be needed to provide the funding to accommodate the required staffing and training levels.

3， What support from Dr. Olsen, the project sponsor, would you expect to support the goal of reducing the procedural errors by 50%?

Dr. Olsen will need to support engaging knowledgeable staff to review the current instructions and support making staff available to attend training. The cost of developing and delivering the training will need to be supported as well.

4， EXTRA CHALLENGE QUESTION! Consider the two project objectives we did not discuss in question 1: 

+  Hospital is the first choice by more than 60% of residents
+ Hospital’s return on assets is greater than 12%

For these very substantial objectives, which stakeholders need to be engaged to achieve them and why are they needed?

To meet these objectives, it is likely the other project objectives need to be met as well. Because of that, all the stakeholders mentioned earlier need to be involved. In addition, engagement from two other stakeholders will be required. Claire Fischer, the Community Resources Manager, will need to provide information and help drive required changes at the hospital. To achieve the goal of the hospital is the first choice by more than 60% of residents, current community awareness activities and perceptions need to be understood. Assistance and support for the activities to enhance those perceptions will require Claire Fischer’s support.

For the project to ensure the hospital’s return on assets is greater than 12% goal is met, the Controller, Maria Diaz, will need to provide data on the current return on assets and assist with strategies to increase that figure.

### **排程项目案例研究**

从练习中，查看以下有关Brisland医院排程项目的信息：

- film《准备项目范围说明书》（第2章）中的范围说明书
- 第1章挑战中的医院组织结构图

film《创建项目章程》提出了关于项目章程内容的建议，包括：

- 项目经理的权限
- 来自项目发起人的支持

回答以下关于项目章程的问题：

1. 项目经理需要获得发起人的授权和支持，与项目利益相关者合作，实现以下范围说明书中的目标：
   - 将重新安排的程序减少75%
   - 软件必须在所有当前计算机平台上运行
   - 将平均程序等待时间减少到30分钟以下
   - 将程序错误减少50%

针对每个目标，请说明您认为的利益相关者是谁，以及为什么这些利益相关者对项目至关重要？

让我们逐个为这些目标回答问题。

##### 将重新安排的程序减少75%

为了确保减少重新安排的程序，必须提供设施以满足患者需求。这可能需要更改程序室的可用时间，并确保在这些时间内有适当的工作人员。

尼古拉斯·安德森（副总裁，一般服务）和大卫·摩尔（设施）是程序室的负责人，因此需要就可用性、设施容量以及程序中使用的设备进行咨询。

如果人员短缺导致重新安排，将需要萨缪尔·坦博士（医疗服务）和克里斯蒂娜·加西亚（护理主任）来确保技术人员、医生和护士能够可用，以减少重新安排的时间并实现此项目目标。

##### 软件必须在所有当前计算机平台上运行

艾米丽·韦伯（IT主任）需要参与：

a. 确保当前平台不会更改，或者如果更改，调度软件将在新平台上运行

b. 确保在IT环境中安装和维护软件，以确保调度系统正常运行

##### 将平均程序等待时间减少到30分钟以下

为了实现这个目标，将需要设施的可用性和容量，因此需要咨询尼古拉斯·安德森（副总裁，一般服务）和大卫·摩尔（设施）关于设施的可用性和容量以及程序中使用的设备。

此外，技术人员的人员配备水平需要由萨缪尔·坦博士（医疗服务）和克里斯蒂娜·加西亚（护理主任）进行维护。可能需要额外的员工接受培训以正确进行程序操作，这将需要教育和培训经理加布里埃尔·科斯塔的参与。

##### 将程序错误减少50%

一般来说，程序错误是由两个问题引起的：对于执行程序的指示写得不好，或者员工教育不足。因此，需要让教育和培训经理加布里埃尔·科斯塔参与，以确保培训适当，萨缪尔·坦博士（医疗服务）和克里斯蒂娜·加西亚（护理主任）及其团队需要审查当前的程序执行指示。

2，关于人员配备以适当利用医院设施并实现将平均程序等待时间减少到30分钟以下的目标，您认为需要发起人奥尔森博士的支持是什么？

除了与所需利益相关者合作的支持外，可能需要增加整体员工水平和培训资金。作为发起人，奥尔森博士的支持将需要提供资金以满足所需的人员配备和培训水平。

3，您期望来自发起人奥尔森博士的支持，以支持将程序错误减少50%的目标是什么？

奥尔森博士需要支持聘请有经验的员工审查当前的指示，并支持让员工参加培训。还需要支持开发和提供培训的成本。

4，额外挑战问题！考虑我们未讨论的两个项目目标：

- 医院是60%以上居民的首选医院
- 医院资产回报率高于12%

为了实现这些非常重要的目标，需要与哪些利益相关者合作，为什么他们是必要的？

为了实现这些目标，很可能需要实现其他项目目标。因此，所有先前提到的利益相关者都需要参与。此外，还需要从其他两个利益相关者那里得到支持。社区资源经理克莱尔·费舍尔需要提供信息并帮助推动医院所需的变革。为了实现医院成为60%以上居民的首选医院的目标，需要了解当前的社区认知活动和看法。加强这些看法的活动需要费舍尔的支持和帮助。

为了确保医院资产回报率高于12%的目标得以实现，财务主管玛丽亚·迪亚兹需要提供关于当前资产回报率的数据，并协助制定增加该指标的策略。
