# Build a Project Schedule

## Put tasks in sequence

### Take Dependencies
+ One task controls the timing of another
  + predecessor
  + successor
+ Status
  + Finish-to-Start Dependencies
  + Finish-to-Finish Dependencies
    + Example: Custimize Features - Test Features
  + Start-to-Start Dependencies
    + Example: Write Draft - Review Draft
  + Start-to-Finish Dependencies
+ Which Task Controls the Other? 
  + Decide
    + predecessor
    + successor

  + Does the start or finish date of the first task control the second task?
  + Does the predecessor control the start or finish of the successor?
