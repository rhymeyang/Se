          A predefined keyword that is prefixed with a #. The #DOM

          An LMHOSTS file keyword that defines which entries
          should be initially preloaded as permanent entries in
          the name cache. The preloaded entries can reduce network
          broadcasts, because the names will be resolved from
          cache rather than making a broadcast. Any entries with a
          #PRE tag get loaded automatically during initialization.

          Accepted domains identify the domains for which the
          organization is solely responsible and the SMTP domains
          from which the server will accept messages. There are
          three types of accepted domains in Exchange 2007:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Authoritative is the domain over which the Exchange
            server has sole responsibility. In a typical
            environment, the organization will have an e-mail
            domain of "company.com" which is hosted by the
            company's e-mail server. If another e-mail system or
            domain exists in the environment, internal and
            external relays are employed.
          </li>
          <li>
            An internal relay is an e-mail domain that is hosted
            by another Active Directory Forest within the Exchange
            organization. This system uses different e-mail
            addresses, but all incoming mail goes through the
            Exchange organization.
          </li>
          <li>
            An external relay accepts e-mail for an external
            organization and then delivers it to an external
            entity such as the Internet via the Edge Transport
            server.

          secured objects. An access token includes the user's SID
          (security ID), ID of users' group memberships, and
          rights assigned to the user. The access token is
          generated during the logon process and is not updated

          provides message integrity through authentication,
          verifying that data are received unaltered from the
          trusted destination. AH provides no privacy however, and
          is often combined with ESP to achieve integrity and
          confidentiality.
