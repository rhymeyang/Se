<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

  <tr>
    <td><div>#DOM</div></td>
    <td>
      <div>
        <p>
          A predefined keyword that is prefixed with a #. The #DOM
          is an LMHOSTS keyword and facilitates domain activity
          such as logon validation over a router or account
          sychronization and browsing.
        </p>
      </div>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><div>#PRE</div></td>
    <td>
      <div>
        <p>
          An LMHOSTS file keyword that defines which entries
          should be initially preloaded as permanent entries in
          the name cache. The preloaded entries can reduce network
          broadcasts, because the names will be resolved from
          cache rather than making a broadcast. Any entries with a
          #PRE tag get loaded automatically during initialization.
        </p>

          length for communicating data.

          length for communicating data.
