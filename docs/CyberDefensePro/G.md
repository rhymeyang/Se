          A predefined keyword that is prefixed with a #. The #DOM

          An LMHOSTS file keyword that defines which entries
          should be initially preloaded as permanent entries in
          the name cache. The preloaded entries can reduce network
          broadcasts, because the names will be resolved from
          cache rather than making a broadcast. Any entries with a
          #PRE tag get loaded automatically during initialization.

          Accepted domains identify the domains for which the
          organization is solely responsible and the SMTP domains
          from which the server will accept messages. There are
          three types of accepted domains in Exchange 2007:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Authoritative is the domain over which the Exchange
            server has sole responsibility. In a typical
            environment, the organization will have an e-mail
            domain of "company.com" which is hosted by the
            company's e-mail server. If another e-mail system or
            domain exists in the environment, internal and
            external relays are employed.
          </li>
          <li>
            An internal relay is an e-mail domain that is hosted
            by another Active Directory Forest within the Exchange
            organization. This system uses different e-mail
            addresses, but all incoming mail goes through the
            Exchange organization.
          </li>
          <li>
            An external relay accepts e-mail for an external
            organization and then delivers it to an external
            entity such as the Internet via the Edge Transport
            server.

          secured objects. An access token includes the user's SID
          (security ID), ID of users' group memberships, and
          rights assigned to the user. The access token is
          generated during the logon process and is not updated

          provides message integrity through authentication,
          verifying that data are received unaltered from the
          trusted destination. AH provides no privacy however, and
          is often combined with ESP to achieve integrity and
          confidentiality.

          A bottleneck is a point in a system of processes that

          Exchange 2007's database engine is referred to as the
          Extensible Storage Engine (ESE). ESE is a transactional
          database that writes information into RAM memory and
          into a log file. Once it is in the log file, it will be
          written to disk. There are a number of files used to
          store information:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            An .edb file is located in the actual database itself.
            All of a user's messages, folders, public folders,
            contacts, appointment information, etc. is all stored
            on the .edb file. An .edb file size can exceed
            multiple GB.
          </li>
          <li>
            A .log file is an ESE transaction log file. All .log
            files are 1 MB.
          </li>
          <li>
            A .jrs file is a reserve log file which is used to
            commit any transactions that are still in memory in
            the event of the server running out of disk space. All
            .jrs files are 1 MB.
          </li>
          <li>
            A .chk file is used to identify which log files have
            been committed to the database. The size of .chk file
            varies from 2-3 KB.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The ESE takes the following steps to write information
          into database files:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The ESE writes a message into memory RAM when it
            arrives at the server.
          </li>
          <li>
            At the same time that information is written to RAM,
            it's written into the current .log file. All current
            log files are named E00.log. The information is
            written in a sequential format until the log file is
            full. When the log file is full, it will be renamed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once it has been committed to the log file, the
            information is written to the .edb file.
          </li>
          <li>
            The checkpoint file is updated to indicate that the
            transaction log that has been committed to the
            database.

          CSMA/CA is the technology used by Ethernet and wireless

        </p>
        <ul>

            If a host detects traffic on the network, it

          </li>
          <li>
            Every transmission must be acknowledged. As every
            frame is acknowledged by the receiving host, other
            hosts receive a message indicating that they must wait
            to transmit.

          This test involves the security server sending a

          performs a one-way hash function on the challenge and
          returns the result to the security server. The security

          Coaxial cable is a type of network transmission media.
          It is an older technology that is usually implemented
          with a bus topology. It is not suitable for ring or star
          topologies because the ends of the cable must be
          terminated. It is composed of two conductors, which
          share a common axis, within a single cable.

          A cold site is a fault tolerant strategy which provides
          a redundant work location. If a disaster renders a work
          site unusable, the effected organization may have a cold
          site in which to relocate. Cold sites have the following
          characteristics:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This is the least ready of alternative site types, but
            it is probably the most common.
          </li>
          <li>
            The site is ready for equipment to be brought in
            during an emergency because there is no hardware on
            site.
          </li>
          <li>
            The site might have electrical power and HVAC, but it
            may or may not have communication links.
          </li>
          <li>
            A cold site is low cost, and may be better than
            nothing.
          </li>
          <li>
            A cold site often offers a false sense of security.
            The actual amount of work involved in getting a cold
            site up and running might be more than expected and
            might take too long to adequately keep the business
            running.
