### 2.2.1 Risk Management Principles

A risk management program works to identify risks and determine how to minimize their likelihood or impact. After identifying risks, the next step is to handle them using different responses. Risk management principles include:

- Minimize an organization's exposure to cyber threats.
- Protect an organization’s assets from unauthorized access, theft, or damage.
- Help organizations comply with data security and privacy regulations and standards.

This lesson covers the following topics:

- Cybersecurity leadership concepts
- Risk identification
- Risk response strategies
- Risk monitoring and evaluation

#### Cybersecurity Leadership Concepts

It is essential to understand the basic concept of leadership in the cybersecurity field. A cybersecurity leader is responsible for creating a vision and setting goals for a team to secure an organization's assets. Additionally, they must understand the technical and legal aspects of the industry and be able to advise on the best approaches for providing appropriate levels of protection. Leaders must have a deep understanding of the industry and its nuances and the ability to make decisions quickly and confidently. A leader in cybersecurity must also possess strong interpersonal skills to communicate effectively with a wide range of technical and non-technical stakeholders.

[James Stanger]
From a government's risk

and compliance perspective
it's all about

getting that set
of requirements and then,

determining the appropriate
risk strategies.

And there's somebody here, London's own, Ian Trump. How are you doing, Ian? I'm doing great, James. Thanks for having me on this. Ian's going to talk
to us a little bit

about his history
and then talk about

what it means to apply
the appropriate risk strategies.

Tell us about yourself
and let's start talking

about some risky business here. All right, sounds good. I'm the CISO for Cyjax, a threat
intelligence company and I,

one of the trends that I'm sort
of tracking and looking at

is the growing importance of GRC in driving businesses decisions and in order to do that, they have to have
the kind of information,

the kind of strategic
information,

to make those decisions. You know, as you're sourcing whether it be external
developers, internal developers

or you're procuring something
from some sort of provider,

what are some of those
risk assessment factors

that you look into? I think a lot of us have heard of whether it be MTTR
or MTBF and et al.,

how do all of those things
work together

to determine
your risk assessment?

Yeah. So, I mean, what you're talking about
is sort of the more,

the operational risk
of this new thing

we're going to bring
into existence

and I mean, it's one thing
to put it on a piece of paper,

it's quite another thing
to actually practice it,

you know, in a lot of cases,
GRC is going to suggest

what they can live with,
what their tolerance is

for downtime and they're going
to pass that requirement

on to the procurement
or to the project manager

in charge of bringing
this new thing to life.

But I think where the focus
now of GRC is really

around what kind
of data do we have,

what kind of policies do we have in place to govern that
particular type of data,

be it a data retention policy or be it all data must
be encrypted at rest

and in transit and then finally, and this is sort of
the new huge issue on the block

that GRC is facing,
is geography.

We want to live
in this global marketplace,

the reality is there are
some countries that are

very sensitive about data, where it is,
who's processing it,

who's prying eyes
are looking at it.

And then, you know,
the aspirations of a sales

and marketing team about doing
business in new territories,

really has to go through
a lens of GRC informing them

that the best approach
would be to get a partner

on the ground because,
you know, setting up

a corporate entity there
might be difficult,

in the case of Latin America,
the Middle East,

that's truly the thing
or it might be impossible

to do without a partner
on the ground

in some other countries. You know, it's interesting
to see too where,

a lot of times, people talk
about the risk of data loss

and that's, that's right,
but so often there are

regulations that will say,
"Well, X company,

if you're going
to go into business

in this particular region, you have to make sure that data
is available to the customers

and if it's not, there are fines and things like
that too," right?

I've seen that. When it comes
to handling risk,

you can transfer, you know, have the insurance company
pick it up, yeah, right.

You can accept
the risk and avoid it.

Let's talk about,
you know, mitigation,

all those different elements
of risk handling.

Yeah. So, first and foremost,
GRC really needs to be

at the front of the, of the line
when it comes to this

because they need to make sure
everybody around the table

understands, you know, what the protections
of that data need to be

from a policy perspective, from a regulatory compliance
perspective.

That should drive
all the discussion amongst,

you know, all of the delivery
efforts so the IT department,

the development department,
security, all of them

need to understand
what it is that's being built,

what the level of risk
to the business is

and then it's time to whiteboard and they'll get creative
solutions for dealing with this.

Now, it's going to cost
money, that's the thing.

So, if you never had
static testing

or dynamic testing
of code, but the data

that you're dealing
with is sensitive enough

to warrant that you need all, to take all of
these precautions,

then, you know, that's something
that needs to be tabled

in the risk, it's going
to affect the budget,

it might even protect,
it might even impact

the delivery time
for the project.

IT security has
to be at the table

and voice their wisdom
on saying,

"Hey, do not worry, we got this. We have similar applications
with similar providers

and this is the de rigueur
that we've put them through,

this is the telemetry
that we're getting

to throw into our SIM,
you know, we got you."

And then, you know,
everyone else

can breathe a sigh of relief
because, you know,

IT security are
the big heroes in this story.

Absolutely. When it comes
to tracking risk,

there are risk registers
for example,

let's talk about
what a risk register is

and then some of
the key performance indicators

of what it means to track risk. Yeah, and, you know,
I will say that GRC's role

has gotten really difficult
because so much risk now

in business is dynamic
and a lot of that dynamic risk

is dependent
on your hosting provider

or the line of business vendor
of the particular thing

because when you think of it,
almost every company out there

is a franking company, you know, they're taking a piece of Oracle
and a piece of Azure

and a piece of Google
and they're throwing it together

and they're building their thing
that makes them money

or they're providing
their service

that think makes money. So, the GRC's role now
I think is really focused on

supply chain issues and compliance
within that supply chain

and trying to, you know,
educate procurement teams and,

and project management
in, you know,

what is the sort
of minimum threshold

that will engage
with the company.

You know, what is
the level of risk tolerance

that we have
in this organization.

Because nobody wants
to buy something

that becomes
the next big hack, right?

That's usually a career ending
decision when that happens.

And I think, GRC's role
now is to really articulate

on that tolerance of risk
and when they work

in conjunction with IT audit, you have a very powerful story
about due diligence

within an organization
and that due diligence,

if the worst happens,
is going to be the thing

that saves the company from heavy regulatory fines
and penalties.

I like to say,
in cyber security,

you can try and fail, that's okay so long as you have
evidence that you tried.

[James] That's right. [Ian] If you don't try
and you fail,

bad things are coming for you. And that's what kind
of registering and,

and documenting
all of this is all about.

-Thank you.
-Yeah.

Keeping it up to date
is super important

because, you know, you're
one privacy complaint away

from an investigation
into, you know,

how that database got
into the hands

of the third-party marketing
company and,

all of a sudden, you know,
hundreds of thousands

of email messages went out. In some territories
of the world,

that's an okay thing, in other territories of
the world, that's a bad thing.

-Serious problems then.
-Yeah.

Ian, thank you so much
for your wisdom

talking about applying
the appropriate risk strategies

in regards,
in regards to GRC, thanks man.

-You're welcome, James.
-Yeah.

#### Risk Identification

Risk identification involves examining all aspects of an organization’s operations, processes, and activities to identify potential hazards, vulnerabilities, or weaknesses that may lead to negative consequences. This process allows organizations to take proactive measures to mitigate these risks and prevent or reduce the negative consequences they may cause.

Risk identification includes identifying potential risks or threats to an organization’s assets, including:

- People
- Systems
- Data
- Finances

#### Risk Response Strategies

After identifying risks, the next step is to handle them using different responses. This process involves analyzing the likelihood and impact of each risk and selecting an appropriate response based on its severity and importance. Responses to risk fall into four distinct categories:

![A box labeled Risk Responses is surrounded by four other boxes labeled: Avoid, Accept, Mitigate, and Transfer.](/images/CyberDefensePro/risk_responses_2.2.1.png)

The four types of risk responses.

<table><thead><tr><th class_="firstTableHeader" scope="col" class="fw-bold">
Risk Type</th>
<th scope="col" class="fw-bold">
Description</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr><td>Avoid</td>
<td>Risk avoidance often means that you stop doing an
activity that is risk-bearing. For instance, risk managers may
discover a software application has numerous high-severity security
vulnerabilities. After reporting this new finding and providing
context to the risks, the governance team may decide that the cost
of maintaining the application, or the probability of catastrophic
failure due to the newly discovered vulnerabilities, is not worth
its benefit and so choose to have it decommissioned.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Accept</td>
     <td>Risk acceptance means continuing to operate
without change after evaluating an identified risk item. The risk
item could be related to software, hardware, or existing processes.
We must consider risk in all we do; even simple daily tasks involve
risks. But despite this, we are still productive and largely safe so
long as we are aware of risks and act within safe limits. Helping
organizations operate this way is precisely the goal of risk
management—to help contain threats within carefully constructed and
mutually agreed-upon boundaries because it is impossible to
eliminate risk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mitigate</td>
<td>Risk mitigation describes reducing exposure to
risk items by implementing mitigating controls to ensure that
technical business operations are safe. For example, there are many
potential security issues associated with web applications. Since
web applications are critical to many business processes, we must
determine how to operate them safely while meeting the
organization's needs. To do this, we use various means to improve
the web application's safety and security through mitigating
controls.
<p></p>
By implementing effective mitigating controls, we can reduce the
overall risk. We implement mitigating controls until risk levels are
reduced to a level deemed "acceptable" by risk managers and
governance teams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transfer</td>
<td>Risk transference (or sharing) means assigning
risk to a third party, which is most typically accomplished through
insurance policies. Insurance transfers financial risks to a third
party. This is an essential strategy as the cost of data breaches
and other cybersecurity events can be extremely high and result in
bankruptcy.</td></tr></tbody></table>

Despite the presence of mitigating controls, some risks may still be troublesome. It could also be that mitigating controls are not available to help reduce the risk level. For example, a different risk response might be warranted, like avoidance. Circumstances may warrant a risk exception if a different risk response is not reasonable or feasible. Issuing a risk exception is a serious decision. It must include careful documentation identifying why the risks are concerning and specific justifications describing why an exception is warranted. The explanation should document the dates when the decision to issue an exception was made and include the signatures of all involved.

#### Risk Monitoring and Evaluation

Risk monitoring and evaluation are critical components of an effective risk management program. Risk monitoring is continually assessing and monitoring potential risks, identifying changes in the risk landscape, and detecting emerging threats or vulnerabilities. This requires ongoing data analysis from internal and external sources, such as threat intelligence feeds, incident reports, and regulatory updates. By monitoring risks continuously, organizations can proactively identify potential issues and take corrective action before they escalate into major problems.

Risk evaluation involves assessing the likelihood and potential impact of identified risks and prioritizing them based on their significance level. This process requires careful analysis of risk data to determine the probability of an event occurring and the potential impact on organizational operations, reputation, and financial stability. Risk evaluation enables organizations to focus on managing the most critical risks and implementing appropriate controls to mitigate their potential impact. Risk monitoring and evaluation provide a comprehensive view of an organization's risk landscape, enabling decision-makers to make informed choices about risk management strategies and ensure ongoing business resilience.

### 2.2.2 Applying the Appropriate Risk Strategies

Click one of the buttons to take you to that part of the video.

Risk Management Principles 00:00-01:17
Cybersecurity risk management refers to identifying and responding to potential physical and digital threats. Risk management helps to minimize an organization's exposure to cyber threats. It also helps organizations comply with data security and privacy regulations and standards. Risk management helps to ensure that organizational assets are well-protected.

People are one of the most important assets to an organization. Skilled and engaged employees can drive innovation, productivity, and overall business success. Customers provide a source of revenue and valuable feedback that can be used to improve products and services and drive future growth.

Computer and network systems are other valuable resources to an organization, enabling efficient data management, business communication, and collaboration among employees. An organization's data hold private customer and organizational information. It also provides insights into customer behavior, operational efficiency, and market trends that drive business success. The security of customers and other confidential data is essential to any organization. And, of course, finances are an important asset. Finances, whether in cash or other investments, provide the foundation for current and future operations.

Risk Identification 01:17-02:27
One of the first steps of risk management is to identify potential risks. Risks can come from various sources, including natural disasters, cyberattacks, human error, and noncompliance with regulatory compliance requirements. An organization's finances, operations, network infrastructure, and reputation can be at risk.

When identifying risk, it's also important to consider the potential repercussions associated with each. Financial repercussions associated with cybersecurity can include stolen funds, lost sales, recovery costs, and regulatory fines or legal costs.

System downtime or disruption, loss of critical data or intellectual property, and compromised or damaged organizational assets and operations are examples of operational risks associated with cybersecurity threats.

Cybersecurity incidents or perceived lack of security measures can result in reputational risks. These could include public exposure of sensitive or confidential data, negative media coverage, social media backlash, and loss of customer trust. Considering the potential repercussions of a risk helps prepare you to assign a response to each.

Risk Response Strategies 02:27-03:25
The next steps of risk management involve evaluating the nature and repercussions of each risk to determine its severity. Once calculated, the severity is then used to determine which response strategy should be applied.

There are four types of risk responses. Risk avoidance involves eliminating or not engaging in activities that pose a potential cyber risk, such as not allowing employees to use personal devices for work-related activities. Risk mitigation involves reducing the likelihood or impact of a cyber threat through proactive measures, such as implementing firewalls and intrusion detection systems.

Risk acceptance involves acknowledging and accepting the potential risk, such as not implementing additional security measures despite being aware of potential vulnerabilities. Risk transfer involves transferring the risk to another party, such as purchasing cybersecurity insurance to help mitigate financial loss resulting from a cyber attack.

Risk Monitoring 03:25-03:56
Finally, it's necessary for cybersecurity organizations to continuously monitor and evaluate potential risks and the effectiveness of their risk response strategies. This involves conducting regular risk assessments, testing security controls, and updating policies and procedures based on changes in the threat landscape or organizational needs. By staying vigilant and adaptable, cybersecurity organizations can be well-prepared to address potential risks and protect their assets from cyber threats and attacks.

Summary 03:56-04:13
That's it for this lesson. In this lesson, we discussed risk management. We talked about identifying financial, operational, and reputational risks. We examined risk response strategies. We also discussed the importance of ongoing monitoring and evaluating potential risks.

### 2.2.3 Threat Modeling

Click one of the buttons to take you to that part of the video.

Threat Modeling 00:00-00:52
As a cybersecurity professional, you help to protect your company's assets and data. One of the best ways to do this is through threat modeling.

Threat modeling is a risk management process that helps identify, quantify, and prioritize potential threats to your business. It's used to evaluate and minimize the risk of a data breach or other malicious activity.

To start, you should analyze your company's assets and data to determine which ones are most important and vulnerable. Then, you can create a list of potential threats, such as a malicious hacker, natural disaster, or cyber-attack. Once you've identified the threats, you can create a plan of action to mitigate the risks. This may include implementing security measures such as firewalls and user authentication or increasing your data backup. By taking the time to analyze and address potential threats properly, you can ensure that your company's assets and data remain secure and protected.

5 Steps of Threat Modeling 00:52-03:06
Now that we've talked about the basics of threat modeling let's look at the five steps involved.

The first step is adversary capability analysis. This involves understanding the capabilities of potential attackers so you can assess the risks they pose to your company. During this phase, you'll identify potential threat sources, determine how likely those attacks will occur, and consider what the adversary is capable of. For example: What damage could they do or what data could be accessed?

The second step is total attack surface analysis. This is a process of evaluating the entire attack surface of your assets to identify all the ways an adversary could access the system. When determining the total attack surface, it's critical to consider any possible entry points, such as external networks or internal applications. During this step, you'll also want to take inventory of the entire network. The inventory should include hardware, software, and the capabilities and processes of each device.

The third step is attack vector analysis. This involves analyzing the different methods attackers may use to gain access to your data, such as malware, phishing scams, or social engineering. An attack vector is a specific path or means by which an attacker can gain access to a system or data. There are three main categories of attack vectors. Cyber-attack vectors involve hardware or software being used for an attack. Human attackers use social engineering techniques such as impersonating or coercing an employee inside the organization. Physical attack vectors involve attackers with malicious intent gaining physical access to the target location.

The fourth step is impact analysis. This step helps you to understand the potential impacts of a breach or attack. The impact could include system repairs, fines, contract penalties, and lost customers. It could also impact your organization's reputation and customer confidence and satisfaction.

The fifth and final step is likelihood analysis. This involves assessing the likelihood of a particular attack occurring based on the information from the previous four steps. When considering the likelihood of a threat, you'll want to consider an attacker's motivation, emerging capabilities, the effectiveness of attacks, and the annual rate of occurrence. These considerations help you decide what chance there is of an attack happening.

Summary 03:06-03:21
That's it for this lesson. In this lesson, we discussed threat modeling and the five steps involved—adversary capability analysis, total attack surface analysis, attack vector analysis, impact analysis, and likelihood analysis.

### 2.2.4 Threat Modeling Facts

This lesson covers the following topics:

- Threat modeling
- The five steps of threat modeling

#### Threat Modeling

Threat modeling is designed to identify the principal risks and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that a system may be subject to by evaluating the system both from an attacker's point of view and the defender's point of view. For each scenario-based threat situation, the model asks whether defensive systems are sufficient to repel an attack perpetrated by an adversary with a given level of capability. Threat modeling can be used to assess risks against corporate networks and business systems, and it can also be performed against more specific targets, such as a website or software deployment. The outputs from threat modeling can be used to build use cases for security monitoring and detection systems. Threat modeling is typically a collaborative process with inputs from various stakeholders. In addition to cybersecurity experts with knowledge of the relevant threat intelligence and research, stakeholders can include non-experts, such as users and customers, and persons with different priorities on the technical side, such as those who represent financial, marketing, and legal concerns.

#### The Five Steps of Threat Modeling

There are five basic threat modeling steps.

##### Adversary Capability Analysis

During the adversary capability analysis step, identify potential threat sources, determine how likely these attacks are, and consider the adversary's capabilities. Threat actors or possible threat sources could specifically target the organization, or the attack could be convenient or opportunistic. Depending on the nature of the organization, sources could include nation-state attackers, organized crime, or hacktivists.

##### Total Attack Surface Analysis

The total attack surface refers to all ways an adversary could access the system. When determining the total attack surface, take inventory of the entire network. The inventory should include hardware, software, and the capabilities and processes of each device.

##### Attack Vector Analysis

An attack vector is a specific point to exploit on the total attack surface. MITRE provides three main categories for attack vectors:

    impersonating or coercing an employee inside the organization.
<br></td></tr>
<tr><td>Physical</td>
<td>The attacker with malicious intent gains physical access to the
    target location.
<br></td></tr></tbody></table>
##### Impact Analysis

An impact analysis evaluates the cost of an attack. It determines how an organization would be impacted if a threat were not stopped.

<li>Customer satisfaction</li>
<li>Customer confidence</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

##### Likelihood Analysis

The likelihood analysis determines the probability that an attack will occur. When considering the likelihood of a threat, you will want to consider the following:

- Attacker's motivation
- Emerging capabilities
- Effectiveness of attacks
- The annual rate of occurrence (ARO)
