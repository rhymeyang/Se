### 9.2.1 Incident Response Training and Testing

Click one of the buttons to take you to that part of the video.

Risk Training 00:00-01:06
One constant when we evaluate system risk is a perpetual need to maintain a well-trained staff. Not only should an organization's cybersecurity staff be competent, but they also require training in offense as well as in defense to help them get into the minds of potential threat actors. To make this happen, security teams often conduct practice exercises to test their knowledge and abilities in attack prevention.

We use different teams for different functions. The red team is the offensive team. Its job is to try and break through defenses and obtain access to an organization's network. The blue team is the defensive team. Its job is to defend the network. Members try and prevent an attack before it occurs. The white team has the unique job of adjudicating these mock attacks between the red and blue teams. They can perform their role during a true mock attack or, alternatively, through hosting tabletop exercises. This is a mock attack that's carried out in a meeting where both sides discuss how a given scenario might be played out. It's the more theoretical of the two exercises.

Red Team 01:06-01:48
As the red team is the offensive team, it takes on the threat actor's role and attempts to gain access to the organization's network resources. Typically, the red team is comprised of experienced ethical hackers. Ethical hackers are trained with hacking tools and techniques. The attack team might also include penetration testers that find weaknesses in the system's outer defenses. Once found, the goal is to do everything possible to breach those defenses. Overall, the red team's primary mission is to gain access to internal resources, like network servers or individual workstations. This role is often outsourced, since the internal source is well-informed about the organization's defensive posture beforehand.

Blue Team 01:48-03:21
As the network defenders, the blue team actively monitors the network to ensure that their defenses haven't been breached and that there's no active attack. The blue team jumps into action if they detect an anomaly or a security alarm goes off. There are a few ways these warnings might come in. When a firewall detects a possible breach or configuration change, it usually sends a warning message to the team with the details. An intrusion detection system, or IDS, sounds a system alarm. An intrusion prevention system, or IPS, takes the more drastic step of attempting a shutdown.

A honeypot is a device that's used to lure an unsuspecting attacker to aimlessly explore. The device itself mimics a live system. But in reality, it's a trap that accounts for the attacker's tools without actually exposing anything sensitive. In addition to hardware devices, the blue team uses software tools to try and figure out what might be happening. The team might use a packet analysis tool, such as Wireshark, to capture packet traffic traversing the wires. Endpoint detection uses AI to identify potential malicious activity, automate responses, and ease threat hunting. This is all a manual process. It's especially beneficial when you're looking for internal attacks.

Logs are an often-overlooked diagnostic tool. Log aggregation tools like Splunk are used to combine log files from various devices, such as servers, routers, and switches. A log aggregation tool makes log files searchable so that an analyst can review them and look for abnormal behavior and attack signatures.

White Team 03:21-03:47
The white team is comprised of staff that oversee compliance, management, logistics, and more. They may or may not be technical staff, but they must be knowledgeable about the security process and how the teams operate. The white team puts everything together and defines the exercise and rules of engagement for the teams to work within. In the end, the white team is responsible for conducting the ultimate risk assessment and for carefully monitoring the activity's progress.

Tabletop Exercises 03:47-04:23
Now that you understand the different teams, we can discuss tabletop exercises. In these exercises, the white team defines a theoretical scenario and specific criteria to evaluate the red and blue teams on. They're given the criteria and rules of engagement beforehand, and then they take some time to strategize. Finally, they all come together and work through the exercise by discussing the what, when, where, why, and how of their respective plans. This is an exercise conducted in a meeting, not on actual equipment. The white team evaluates and scores the teams based on who presented a better solution.

Summary 04:23-05:01
That's it for this lesson. In this lesson, we discussed the requirements for the different risk training teams. This training provides safety considerations for an organization's exposure and risk. The red team assumes the attacker's role and uses hacking techniques to defeat system protections. The blue team defends the network and uses their skills and experience to prevent exposure and to stop the red team's advances. The white team is the decision-making team that designs tabletop exercises and rules of engagement to adjudicate exercises, whether they be on actual equipment or just conceptual.

### 9.2.2 Incident Response Training and Testing Facts

Training for possible threats helps keep everyone prepared for an eventual attack. Practicing attack scenarios helps find weaknesses and identify potential vulnerabilities.

This lesson covers the following topics:

- Training
- Tabletop exercise
- Testing

#### Training

The actions of staff immediately following the detection of an incident can have a critical impact on successful outcomes. Effective training on incident detection and reporting procedures equip staff with the knowledge to react swiftly and effectively to security events. Incident response is also likely to require coordinated efforts from several departments or groups, so cross-departmental training is essential. The lessons learned phase of incident response often reveals a need for additional security awareness and compliance training for employees. This type of training helps employees develop the knowledge to identify attacks in the future.

Training should focus on more than just technical skills and knowledge. Security incidents can be very stressful and quickly cause working relationships to crack. Training can improve team building and communication skills, giving employees greater resilience when adverse events occur.

#### Tabletop Exercise

A tabletop exercise evaluates the effectiveness of incident response procedures. The tabletop exercise focuses on a particular objective to determine whether all parties involved in the response know what to do and can work together to accomplish the desired outcome. The individual leading the tabletop exercise outlines a specific (imaginary) event to which the team must respond. During the response, the activity leader will expand on the scenario by adding new details or an additional event/consequence to which the participating teams must adapt.

For example, a tabletop exercise might use a large-scale ransomware infection as a scenario and challenge the leadership team to manage the event. Information is provided to the leadership team to parallel how the event would unfold during a real crisis. As the team makes decisions, the facilitator provides realistic consequences and responses. Often, the team is challenged to manage a "plot twist" while dealing with a different issue, such as creating a press release in response to an urgent media request for information. Tabletop exercises can be very effective when led by an experienced facilitator.

#### Testing

There are few ways to prove beyond a doubt that incident handling procedures are robust enough to cope with significant breaches or DDoS attacks, but the best approach is testing. Testing comes with challenges, as arranging a test to simulate an attack is costly and complex. There are various test methodologies, including tabletop exercises to analyze an incident scenario or compare controls against a framework model, but the most accurate is penetration testing (pen testing). In this type of test, a team of penetration testers attempts an intrusion using a specific scenario devised using threat modeling. Incident responders use established procedures to detect and repel the attack.

Leadership can initiate testing in this way with or without the knowledge of the incident responders. Excluding incident responders from the plan can evaluate their effectiveness, although this can be a humbling experience for all but the most battle-hardened incident responders.

There are three primary teams for this type of testing, and they are often referred to using the following names:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Type</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>Red team</td>
  <td>
    These are skilled hackers that use their skills to attack the
    specified target. Often, this team is outsourced since most internal
    staff are aware of internal controls used to block access.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Blue team</td>
  <td>
    These are the skilled defenders of the network. They are the
    defensive side in the exercise. They use their skills to configure
    protection devices, scan and monitor the network for unusual
    activity, and do what they can to stop it.

### 9.2.3 Incident Response Overview

Click one of the buttons to take you to that part of the video.

Incident Response Overview 00:00-00:10
In this video, I'm going to talk about how to respond to security incidents that could happen within your organization.

Incident Response Plan 00:10-01:20
A security incident is an event or series of events that result from a security policy violation and that has adverse effects on a company's ability to proceed with business. Security incidents can include employee errors, unauthorized employee acts, insider attacks, external intrusion attempts, virus or harmful code attacks, or unethical gathering of competitive information.

Incident response is the actions you take to deal with an incident during and after it occurs. Prior planning helps people know what to do, and all company leaders should be familiar with the incident response plan. At least one member in every department should be trained to recognize abnormal activities, suspicious behavior, unauthorized activity, and irregular patterns in employee conduct. When an employee discovers an incident, he or she should recognize and declare it, preserve any evidence, and contact the appropriate personnel.

Incident response should identify the problem, investigate how it occurred, and implement forensics to preserve evidence. This includes removing the incident's cause, recovering and repairing any damages, and documenting and implementing countermeasures to reduce a future attack's likelihood.

Incident Response Life Cycle 01:20-03:07
Each of these areas form what we call the incident response life cycle. There are five stages in this life cycle—preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication and recovery, and post-incident activity.

The preparation phase gives you an opportunity to reinforce your system so that you can bounce back in the event of a security incident. During this phase you ensure that your systems have been secured and that you have policies, procedures, and resources in place to help streamline your response.

The detection and analysis phase gives you a chance to identify an attack or an incident after it has begun. This phase also helps to determine an attack's severity.

The containment phase reduces an incident's impact. This phase's primary goal is to make sure the incident doesn't impact customers and external business partners any more than necessary. This is done by isolating affected systems and restricting communication to only trusted individuals.

After the incident has been contained, you can eradicate the source of the problem and begin the recovery process. Eradication is complete removal and resolution. This means that the root issue is resolved and all devices are fully hardened. In some instances, this could mean a full reimaging of host machines. It could also involve adjusting permissions or hardening network resources.

The post-incident phase includes two parts, which are the post-incident activity and post-incident feedback. The post-incident activity phase includes the creation of reports that summarize the incident, the response, and any recommendations for future action. During the activity phase, you also want to hold meetings to discuss lessons learned. The post-incident feedback phase includes taking the recommendations and putting them into action through security implementations, policies, and procedures.

Summary 03:07-03:27
That's it for this lesson. In this lesson, we talked about what incident response is. We also discussed the 5 phases of the incident response life cycle—preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication and recovery, and post-incident activity.

### 9.2.4 Incident Response Overview Facts

Incident response planning is preparing and developing a strategy to handle security incidents. Organizations must have an action plan to protect their data, resources, and systems when a security incident occurs. This plan includes the identification of threats, the steps to mitigate any potential risks, and the resources needed to respond to an incident. The success of incident response activities depends on the organization's ability to identify potential threats and implement standardized processes to respond to them.

This lesson covers the following topics:

- Incident response planning
- Incident response life cycle
- Response methods
- Preparing for Post-incident Activity Phases (Video)

#### Incident Response Planning

Incident response (IR) planning helps organizations create a plan to identify, investigate, and respond to potential threats and incidents. A well-crafted incident response plan will provide the guidelines, resources, and protocols needed to minimize the impact of a security incident and ensure business continuity. Incident response plans are crucial to protecting an organization’s assets in the event of a security incident. Without a plan, organizations risk being unprepared to respond effectively and efficiently to potential threats and incidents or being unable to minimize the damage from these events. By exposing potential risks and outlining appropriate responses, incident response planning activities help organizations maintain the security of their systems and data, protect their reputations, and minimize damages from security incidents.

Any effort to prepare for and respond to security incidents is considered incident response planning. Formal planning activities include threat modeling, risk analysis, policy and process development, testing, and simulations. These activities help identify risks and threats, assess their potential impacts, and create and implement the response plans, tools, and resources required to prevent and respond to security incidents.

Incident response planning activities are often part of the broader terms “incident response” and “incident response planning,” which also encompass responding to security incidents once they occur. This includes creating guidelines for responding to certain types of incidents, identifying the resources needed for each response, and establishing protocols for how the different personnel and groups will work together to mitigate incidents.

#### Incident Response Life Cycle

Incident response plans (IRP) are the actions and guidelines for dealing with security events. An incident occurs when security is breached, or there is an attempted breach; NIST describes an incident as "the act of violating an explicit or implied security policy." The NIST Computer Security Incident Handling Guide special publication ( [nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/specialpublications/nist.sp.800-61r2.pdf) ) identifies the following stages in an incident response life cycle (Containment and Eradication & Recovery were separated into different phases).

![Phases in incident response. From left to right: preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication and recovery, and post-incident activity. An arrow points from eradication and recovery to detection and analysis. Another arrow points from post-incident activity to preparation.](/images/CyberDefensePro/incident_resp_1_9.2.4.png)

There are five stages in the incident response life cycle:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Phase</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>Preparation</td>
  <td>
    The preparation phase allows you to reinforce your system so that
    you can bounce back in the event of a security incident. Systems
    should be made more resilient to attacks in the first place. This
    includes hardening systems, writing policies and procedures, and
    setting up confidential lines of communication. It also implies the
    creation of incident response resources and procedures.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Detection &amp; analysis</td>
  <td>
    The detection and analysis phase involves identifying an attack or
    an incident after it has begun. This also includes determining and
    assessing how severe it might be (triage), followed by notification
    of the incident to stakeholders.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Containment</td>
  <td>
    In the containment phase, the goal is to take steps to limit the
    scope and magnitude of the incident. This helps to prevent the
    breach from spreading and causing further damage. The principal aim
    of this phase is to secure data while limiting the immediate impact
    on customers and business partners. If possible, disconnect affected
    devices from the network and the internet. Any strategy you
    implement should depend on whether the attack is ongoing or
    complete.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Eradication &amp; recovery</td>
  <td>
    <p>
      Once the incident is contained, the cause can be removed, and the
      system returned to a secure state. Eradication is the complete
      removal of the problem. In this phase, all causes of the problem
      are removed, and devices are completely malware-free.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recovery includes a full or partial reconstruction to bring the
      system to full function. Recovery should also include evaluating
      system security and hardening network resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      As demonstrated by the arrow from Eradication &amp; Recovery to
      Detection &amp; Analysis, the response process may have to iterate
      through multiple phases of detection, containment, and eradication
      to effect a complete resolution.
    </p>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Post-incident activity</td>
  <td>
    The post-incident activity and feedback phase, also referred to as
    the lessons learned phase includes:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Creating the proper documentation regarding the incident, the
        response, and any recommendations for future action.
      </li>

#### Response Methods

A security incident is an event or series of events resulting from a security policy violation that adversely affects a company's ability to proceed with business. Security incidents can include any of the following:

- Employee errors
- Unauthorized acts by employees
- Insider attacks
- External intrusion attempts
- Virus and harmful code attacks
- Disclosure of proprietary information

Incident response is the actions taken to deal with a security incident during and after the incident. Prior planning helps people know what to do when a security incident occurs. All company leaders and technical employees should be familiar with the incident response plan. At least one member in every department should be trained to recognize abnormal activities, suspicious behavior, unauthorized activity, and irregular patterns in employee conduct. Appropriate actions for an employee to take when discovering an incident are:

- Recognize and declare the event.
- Preserve any evidence that may be used in an investigation.
- Contact the appropriate personnel.

##### Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

Identifying indicators of compromise (IoCs) is the first step in incident response, and what happens next is highly dependent upon what tools are in place. An indicator of compromise represents a clue (or sometimes a clear notice!) that the environment has been breached in some way. By definition, monitoring for indicators of compromise is reactive and, therefore, most effective when IoCs can be detected as early as possible. The potential sources of information used to locate IoCs are vast, but heavy emphasis is placed on log data and end-user reporting of suspicious activities.

SIEM tools play a critical role in monitoring for IoCs. They can collect and process log information across many sources and reconstitute the data into actionable outputs. In high-volume/high-capacity environments, the amount of log data generated by infrastructure and systems is overwhelmingly vast. SIEM platforms help funnel this mountain of data into outputs that are more easily understood by analysts. They also enable outputs to be automatically pre-analyzed by SOAR tools.

High-priority alerts generated by any security tool warrant immediate and close inspection. For example, alerts of vulnerabilities with a severity rating of 10/10, labeled as severe, or with high-priority ratings, such as when suricata rules match with a priority value of 1, should be investigated first. Alerts should not be processed in the order in which they were received.

The following is a summary list of some common indicators of compromise:

- Atypical or unusual inbound and outbound network traffic
- Administrator, root, or other highly privileged accounts being used in any unexpected way
- Any account activity representing access or actions which should not be possible using the identified account
- A high volume of invalid password entries
- Unexpected increases in traffic volumes, especially database or DNS traffic
- High volumes of requests to access a single file
- Suspicious changes to the Windows registry or any unusual change to system files
- Atypical requests to Domain Name Servers (DNS) or strange domain name resolution requests
- Any unauthorized changes to system settings and/or mobile device profiles
- Large quantities of compressed files stored in unexpected locations
- Traffic originating from countries where the organization does not operate or have any business dealings
- Any strange or unknown applications running on a system
- Any unknown or suspicious scheduled tasks
- Strange or unknown processes running on a system
- Strange or unknown services installed on a system
- Alerts from IDS/IPS, firewalls, endpoint protection, or any other security tools
- Any unexpected instances of encrypted files
- Any activity on a system that indicates remote access/control that is not expected

#### Preparing for Post-incident Activity Phases

Preparing for Post Incident 00:00-08:30
James Stanger: You know, when it comes to incident response, you've gotta make sure you have the right kind of plan. To talk to us more about that plan, we've brought in Mitre's Jamie Williams. Jamie, how you doing?

Jamie Williams: Pretty good. How are you?

James Stanger: Doing great. Jamie is the Principal Adversary Emulation Engineer at Mitre and you know quite a lot about incident response. Let's start talking a bit about what it means to actually create that plan. What are some of the tools and things, for example, playbooks that you use to make sure you actually have a plan?

Jamie Williams: Yeah, so incident response is one of those really interesting topics because it sounds like, you know, it sounds like a really straight forward process, but really in reality, it's stressful. You know, alarms are going off, you know, lights are flashing, you know, a lot of people are yelling, people are concerned and scared.

So you really need to like, exactly as you said, have a plan. Make sure you're not, you know, you're not just doing improv. You don't know what you're doing and you're panicking, but really like you said, you have those playbooks. We have step by step, almost thinking of it like, a recipe; like you're baking a cake. What's step one, what's step two?

Even if you're not gonna follow that verbatim, making sure you kind of have that checklist to make sure, you know, you're making, you know, you're proceeding through all those steps, but also just that confidence of looking back and saying, you know, you're giving yourself that benefit of you know, I'm doing the right thing right now.

And again, I think, regarding, it's a little bit of a cliche, but you know, everyone always says, like, planning's the most important step. For incident response, it really is because it's just, you don't, you know, there's so many things going on in terms of making sure you have the right data, the right people are involved, you're communicating with the right stakeholders.

You know, the conclusions are going to the right places. All of that just isn't going to happen on its own, so whether you're, you know, documenting that or you know, tabletopping it in advance, just making sure, you know, when that alarm goes off or when that alert fires into the dashboard, you know instinctively, you know, where to go, what to start doing. I think that's really what we're trying to capture versus you know, everyone throwing their hands up and just starting doing whatever feels right and eventually just leading to a really bad place.

James Stanger: But like you suggested, improv is probably a bad thing to be doing 100% of the time. Now what does a playbook look like, for example, and how do you create one? Is it a spreadsheet? Is it a collection of documents, things like that?

Jamie Williams: I like to think of 'em, like, it could be a spreadsheet. I like to, like I said before, think of it more like a recipe of like, what needs to happen, where are the ingredients? Whether it's data, whether it's certain resources, particular positions. Who needs to be involved, what are they doing? And really, how do we proceed from, you know, identification of an incident to that eradication and recovery?

So what do those steps look like? And exactly as you said, it might take many different forms, whether it's, you know, a password being leaked or a system going down or you know, even more particular threats like Ransomware or we're having [data exfil]. So it can take a lot of different forms, but really organizations can start, you know, documenting and billing those out, especially your business is gonna be very different.

The way you handle this, who's in involved? What tools and what resources you have are not only gonna be different for you, but also are gonna evolve and grow over time. So not only, you know, as you know, you're buying new tools and you're hiring new staff, staff's leaving, you're automating things, but also, you know, as you're going through that process.

You know, thinking about like, the recipe example, you know, you might have a really simple recipe for baking a cake and maybe you use it and you realize, okay, there's a fourth step or there's a fifth step or maybe the oven needs to be a little bit hotter.

So treating it like a living document where as you're using it, as you're table-topping it, as more people see it, documenting more, adding more context and really kinda using it almost like a knowledge management system. Again to your point where, you know, in case of emergency, break glass, you basically have these cheat sheets for exactly what to do to make sure you're kinda checking all those boxes and getting back to a good place.

James Stanger: Because this is really how to maintain business continuity, protecting the most important elements, the crown jewels of the organization, right?

Jamie Williams: Exactly. Security is an enabler for the business. So again, you know, an imperfect incident response plan would be just to turn everything off and stop production. I mean, that might, unfortunately it might have to come to that sometimes, but ideally you kinda have that, you know, kind of exactly as you said, lens of, how do I get things back, not only to operational state, but safe? But also, you know, understanding how did we get here and how do I prevent this from happening again? And how can I use both that, you know, retroactive playing process as well as maybe insight some others to maybe bolster that?

James Stanger: And so getting the word out about the playbook as it were, you use things like tabletop exercises and live fire training and things like that. Tell me a bit about tabletop exercises.

Jamie Williams: Yeah, so it might seem silly, but it can be as simple as sitting down with the right stakeholders and saying, you know, you have a machine that starts floating off to a known bad IP. What do you do? Who's involved? What's step one, what's step two? 'Cause again, like you said, it might seem like a silly question.

You know, we have Ransomware. We have had Ransomware alert on one host, where our domain controller goes down. It might seem like a really simple and silly question, but you know, as you start to really think through, well, what's step one, what's more important? And especially, all the stakeholders that might be at that table, there might be a lotta different opinions and maybe some, you know, disagreements that need to be hashed out before.

Exactly like you said, last thing you want is the situation to be real and then you're dealing with those disagreements and kinda struggling to make decisions versus already kinda thinking that through and knowing exactly, okay, the IR team goes first, the forensic team goes second. You know, the mediation team goes third, then communication and admins.

Whatever your process is, making sure it's something that not only is documented, but is mutually agreed upon, 'cause the last thing you want is ten chefs in the kitchen arguing over who uses the oven first.

James Stanger: That's great. And then, from tabletop, you actually go to actually let's do an actual drill. You know, a visible drill as it were, you know, throughout the entire organization to see how well that tabletop exercise worked, right?

Jamie Williams: Exactly, it's like a fire drill. Like, everyone just says, like, getting out of the building seems easy, but then you don't know the doors you might cross or the hallways you might have to walk through, the different staircases. So exactly like you said, actually making sure that you know what it looks like. You know, it's not gonna be a surprise to you when this big alert goes on the dashboard, but also it's a really good opportunity for process refinement and tuning, in terms of, well, the tabletop, things might've seemed ideal.

You might've thought best case scenario, but in reality, when you actually kinda go through those motions, it might not be as clear. There might be a little bit more nuance and a lot more, you know, maybe the alert isn't as clear as it should've been or shutting down that system isn't as easy as you thought it would be. So, just making sure you kind of, you know, work out all those kind of, you know, that connective tissue so that again, ideally, when an incident happens, this isn't the first time you've done all those steps in terms of baking that cake.

James Stanger: Okay, so the cake has been baked, right. It's even been served, as it were. You know, we're after the incident, as it were. What kind of post incident activity is there? For example, a root cause analysis, things like that. How does that work?

Jamie Williams: Root cause analysis is a huge one 'cause the first thing you wanna understand is why? Why this happened, but most importantly, how do we stop this from happening again? But I think one of the other big ones that is under-appreciated is just taking a step back and understanding the bigger picture, but also communicating that and sharing that with others.

You know, was anyone else impacted by this? Should they be informed about this? But also, has anyone else lived through this? Has anyone baked a cake and maybe it wasn't as soft as we wanted? Maybe the cream just wasn't right. Looking at, is there lessons learned that we can take from other folks who lived this exact same experience? Maybe they had the same malware, they had these same alerts.

Is there things that they noticed that they did that we can learn from and maybe adopt into our recipe, but also things that we can share with them and really build this out as a community? 'Cause really, at the end of the day, it's us versus these adversaries, so the more that we can kinda share these lessons learned and kinda pass these nuggets back and forth, the better cakes we're gonna bake all together.

James Stanger: You know, you're making me hungry to learn more about security and also to go out and get a nice cake, so Brian, thank you so much, it's been fantastic to learn about what it means to do some proactive, some preparation for that playbook and also post incident recovery in regards to an incident. Thank you so much, man.

Jamie Williams: Thanks for having me.

### 9.2.6 Incident Response Preparation

Click one of the buttons to take you to that part of the video.

Incident Response Preparation 00:00-00:22
An organization should be able to respond to security incidents calmly and consistently. This is almost impossible without plenty of preparation. The purpose of an incident response plan is to adequately prepare for security incidents. It is proactive rather than reactive.

Policies and Procedures 00:22-01:03
An incident response plan provides the baseline—the policies and procedures—an organization should follow in the event of a security incident.

A policy should outline roles and levels of authority, define security incidents, specify performance measures, and include necessary contact and report forms. Be sure not to include specific technologies in your policies, as these are subject to change frequently. You don't need to explain your specific response procedures in your policies; that's part of your procedures.

A procedure should include a detailed technical operational plan and play-by-play response strategies, often documented in a playbook.

Documentation 01:03-01:07
Documentation is a critical part of any incident response plan.

Plan Documentation 01:07-02:23
Plan documentation should be easy to read and should include concise guidelines that can be easily referred to as needed during an incident response event. Resources, policies, and procedures should be well-documented and should be easily accessible to executives and staff members. The only way to ensure adequate coordination is to maintain excellent records.

There are a few documents that should be part of all incident response plans. First, an incident checklist that provides an overview of activities that should be completed any time there is an incident. Incident response can be fast-paced and stressful, so the checklist helps make sure important steps aren't missed. An escalation list includes the contact information for the person or persons responsible for responding to an incident. The contact person may differ depending on the type and severity of the incident. This list should be printed out and easily accessible. An incident form is used to track critical details about an incident. It should include the date and time of an incident. It should specify who or what detected the incident and where. And it should include a description of the incident and a detailed explanation of the response.

Data Criticality and Prioritization 02:23-04:05
Waiting to take stock of what you have until after an attack is a choice your future self will regret. Many organizations have found themselves in the uncomfortable situation of trying to figure out what information is missing or compromised after an attack. Although it's time-consuming, it's definitely better to track your data before you lose it. The data criticality and prioritization process provides your organization with information and documentation on what types of information – public and private – is processed, where it's processed, and who has access to this information.

Let's look at several types of data that should be secured and tracked closely. First is personal identifiable information. This could include a person's name, date of birth, address, and social security number – specific things that can be used to differentiate one person from another. Next is personal health information such as insurance information, medical records, and lab results. Sensitive personal information includes data that is private and could result in a potential bias for hiring or other decision-making purposes. This could include religious or political beliefs or sexual orientation, and its collection requires consent. Individual financial information includes banking accounts and credit card information. Corporate information includes data from all aspects of a business, like customer information, contracts, legal records, and product development. Information that is proprietary to an organization is often subject to intellectual property rights and could include details about copyrights, patents, or trademarks.

Communication Plan 04:05-04:11
Incident response involves communication and coordination between multiple internal and external parties.

Internal Communication 04:11-05:29
As part of your planning process, you should establish a response team and appoint someone as its point of contact. System administrators know their network and their equipment. They're the best equipped to provide information, detect the cause of an incident, and help with recovery efforts. Most incidents should be reported to an immediate supervisor or manager. Depending on the nature of the incident, you may also need to escalate the matter to members of your senior management team. Your management team may decide to bring additional stakeholders into the loop. For example, any time there's room for compliance issues, regulatory violations, or potential lawsuits, a legal team should be involved. Additionally, If an incident could result in negative publicity, your public relations representative will need to know. They'll handle the release of information through reputable sources and agencies. Any questions from the outside should be fielded through public relations.

Secure communication methods such as email, messaging, and phone calls should be established during the incident response planning phase. Because of the sensitive nature of incident response, you don't want to risk employees using unsecured and unapproved methods of communication while sharing information about an incident.

External Reporting Requirements 05:29-07:33
Depending on the type of breach you experience, various laws and regulations may require you to report security incidents.

Law enforcement may need to be contacted or may contact you when an incident involves criminal activity. Organizations should seek legal counsel before responding to requests from law enforcement agencies. Vendors may also prove to be helpful during an incident. Because their technologies are being used within the organization, they may be able to help with recovery, security patches, guidance, or troubleshooting. Contact information for all relevant vendors should be maintained. If your organization falls under a regulatory body, you may be required to report security incidents. Your incident response plan should include what type of incidents should be reported, who you should report to, and when you need to make the reports. Many organizations assign a primary contact person to handle interactions with regulatory bodies. This is important for smooth and consistent communication.

Let's look at a few common incident types that may require outside reporting. Data exfiltration occurs when an attacker removes or transfers data from your system to another. In some instances, data exfiltration can be hard to prove because the information isn't missing, it's just been copied. Because of this, a suspected breach should be treated as seriously as a known breach.

Insider data exfiltration is the same as data exfiltration except that it's performed by an employee or someone with authorized access to the system. Some attacks are designed to target the availability or integrity of a system or network. Even if there isn't a suspected data breach, you may still need to report these types of incidents.

An accidental data breach usually happens because of an employee error or a system misconfiguration. If the breach results in data being shared with unauthorized persons, the incident will probably need to be reported. If a device is lost or stolen, it may also need to be reported.

Training and Testing 07:33-08:00
One of the most important parts of incident response preparation is making sure that your systems and employee know what to do. Penetration testing can be done to ensure that your systems are ready, and training can be done to ensure that your employees are ready. The failure or success of a team to detect, eradicate, and recover from a security incident can have a serious impact on an organization's time, finances, and reputation.

Summary 08:00-08:19
That's it for this lesson. In this lesson, we discussed incident response preparation. We reviewed the importance of policies and procedures, documentation, a communication plan, training, and testing.

### 9.2.7 Incident Response Plan Components Facts

The purpose of an incident response plan is to adequately prepare for security incidents. It helps an organization respond to security incidents calmly and consistently. An incident response plan provides the baseline for an organization’s incident response. The plan outlines policies and procedures that should be followed in the event of a security incident. Organizations should tailor an incident response plan to their unique needs and circumstances, but they all have common components.

This lesson covers the following topics:

- Incident response policies
- Incident response procedures
- Incident response tools and resources
- Creation of response plans
- Testing of response plans

#### Incident Response Policies

Incident response policies are statements of the organization's expectations and procedures for responding to security incidents. These policies typically describe which incident types must be reported and should provide detailed descriptions of the steps to be taken in the event of an incident, the roles and responsibilities of those involved, and the communication protocols to be followed. The organization should also develop a timeline for responding to incidents, including the timeline for reporting and responding to them. It should also include a timeline for determining the cause of the incident, the recovery process, and the steps to prevent similar incidents in the future.

A policy should include:

- Definition of what constitutes a security incident.
- Outline roles and levels of authority.
- Include necessary contact and report forms.
- Specify performance measures.

A policy should not contain:

- A list of specific technologies. These are subject to change.
- A detailed technical operational plan.
- Documentation of response procedures.
- Specific forensic or evidence-gathering methods.

#### Incident Response Procedures

Incident response procedures describe organizations' actions during incident response. These procedures include the protocols for how different parts of the organization work together to mitigate incidents and the procedures for how individuals should respond. They provide a detailed technical operational plan with play-by-play response strategies.

  <td>Ransomware</td>
  <td>
    A ransomware playbook describes the people, processes, and tools to
    be employed during such an event. It should include considerations
    for determining which systems were impacted, methods by which
    impacted systems can be immediately isolated, and identification and
    engagement with the people needed in the response. Ransomware
    responses should include disconnecting and isolating networks as
    quickly as possible. It is preferable to disconnect systems as
    opposed to powering them off to maintain forensic integrity and
    potentially extract cryptographic keys from system memory which can
    be used for remediation.

    from the literal movement of data files to less obvious examples,
    such as is accomplished via an SQL injection attack. Data
    exfiltration playbooks include the specific and necessary tasks
    needed in response to data exfiltration, including notification
    requirements and system and network forensic analysis to determine
    exactly what was accessed. Sometimes analysis can reveal the
    locations where data was copied, which can help in response
    decisions. Deleting copies of data on an adversary's system is
    considered a hack-back action. It may only offer limited mitigation
    depending on whether additional copies of the data exist.

    A social engineering playbook often involves responses in relation

    identified, an official notice should be broadcast to advise of the
    attack and encourage others who may have responded to the email to
    step forward. In parallel, the phishing email should be searched for
    within the entire email system to identify any other instances, and
    any elements within the email (such as dynamic body content,
    hyperlinks, and attachments) should be analyzed within a sandbox to
    fully understand what the message is designed to do. Information
    extracted from sandbox analysis can be used to feed security
    infrastructure, such as blocking access to IP addresses and URLs, as
    well as crafting updated detection rules in IDS, AV, etc. At a bare
    minimum, impacted individuals should have their passwords reset and
    possibly replace their desktop systems.

#### Incident Response Tools and Resources

Incident response tools and resources describe the wide range of specialized tools needed during an incident response. Incident response activities require everything from simple phone numbers of support teams, to software to manage the incident response process, to specialized tools designed to help better understand what is happening. Organizations often use various types of incident response planning software to help identify potential threats and incidents, conduct risk analyses, and create response plans. The software can also be used for testing and exercising incident response plans and for maintaining those plans over time. Some common tools associated with incident response include the following:

</table>

**Identification of Potential Threats and Incidents** - Threat modeling, risk analysis, and other threat identification activities can help organizations identify potential threats and incidents that could impact the organization. Incident types include cyberattacks, natural disasters, and other events that could disrupt normal operations. Threat modeling tools can help organizations create threat models and analyze identified threats and incidents comprehensively by creating detailed diagrams that support team collaboration.

**Assessment of Potential Impacts** - Organizations use risk analysis and impact assessments to measure the scope of identified incidents in the organization. Risk analysis tools include guided questionnaires and templates designed to help individuals collect information and produce detailed reports on their findings.

#### Creation of Response Plans

Organizations create response plans to handle incidents based on the threats and incidents identified during risk assessment activities. Response plans should leave little to the imagination. They should be concise and direct, with detailed steps and clear expectations. Flowcharts are a popular tool in the incident response arsenal. An example flowchart for responding to a malware infection event may be similar to this one:

![A flow chart lists the steps from response start to mitigation start.](/images/CyberDefensePro/incident_resp_plan_9.2.7.png)

A flowchart for responding to a malware infection event.

The steps are as follows:

1. Locate the infected systems or resources, such as websites, databases, desktops, servers, mobile, and email.
2. Identify any unauthorized access to those resources.
3. How did malware enter the environment via those resources?
4. Identify the vulnerability used by malware via threat intelligence source, server and event logs, application logs, or a vulnerability scanner.
5. Determine the scope of infection.
6. Use tools to locate malware, such as SIEM, IDS, firewall, EDR, and other specialized tools.

#### Testing of Response Plans

Organizations test response procedures to ensure that personnel know how to respond to specific incidents and that the responses are effective. It is critical that all participants are properly trained as well as participate in testing. Some incident response testing activities include the following:

<table>

  <td>Tabletop exercises</td>
  <td>
    Tabletop exercises are a type of incident response planning activity

    setting, to test the effectiveness of their communication and
    response plans.
  </td>

### 9.2.8 Triage and Incident Response Facts

Incident response involves more than software and devices. The people and organizations that depend on technology need to know what is happening in a language that is meaningful to their point of view.

This lesson covers the following topics:

- Triage event
- Playbooks
- Documentation

#### Triage Event

Properly determining the scope of a security incident occurs during triage. Triage work is dependent upon the skills and knowledge of the individuals performing the work. It includes careful curation of the data and tools useful in locating any indicators of compromise. Individuals performing this work should have specialized training and experience in a live system, digital forensics, and memory and malware analysis.

Triage work is often performed on endpoints, within executable and binary files, and using enterprise security infrastructure tools such as SIEM. Ultimately, triage work is focused on determining a timeline of what, where, how, and when events occurred.

Having clearly defined processes, thresholds, and notification procedures in place as part of a security incident pre-escalation plan is imperative to rapid response. The lack of a clear plan regarding what constitutes an urgent situation or knowledge of what to do when a situation is identified will result in problems being stuck in ticket queues or bogged down in bureaucracy. At the same time, an adversary furthers the impacts of their attack.

#### Playbooks

Incident response playbooks are an invaluable tool for organizations to quickly and efficiently respond to security incidents. With an incident response playbook, organizations define the steps they need to take to respond to a security incident, such as the specific roles, processes, and procedures that security staff must follow. Incident response playbooks also guide communication with stakeholders and the public, as well as guide how to gather evidence and determine the incident's root cause.

Oftentimes the playbook is just that—a physical book used by a security analyst in response to an incident. It is a checklist of actions to perform to detect and respond to a specific type of incident. Using a physical book ensures its availability during a wide-scale incident. In a highly secure environment, it also ensures the IR capabilities are not digitally exfiltrated by attackers.

The most effective incident response playbooks are tailored to an organization's specific security needs and provide detailed guidance on responding to various security incidents. For example, a playbook may contain detailed instructions on responding to a ransomware attack or a data breach. Additionally, the playbook should include guidance on the necessary steps to contain the incident, such as isolating affected systems and measures to ensure the incident is fully resolved.

When creating an incident response playbook, organizations should ensure they have the right level of detail and that all necessary stakeholders are involved, including security teams, IT staff, legal teams, and other personnel who may be involved in responding to the incident. Organizations should update the incident response playbook as new threats and technologies emerge.

#### Documentation

Documentation is a critical part of any incident response plan. Plan documentation should:

- Be easy to read.
- Include concise guidelines.
- Document resources, policies, and procedures.
- Be easily accessible by executives and staff members.
- Be easy to refer to during an incident response event.

> Maintaining excellent records will help ensure coordination, sharing of information, and the best possible incident response.

The following table provides a list of commonly maintained incident response documents:

The data criticality and prioritization process:

- Identifies the types of information (public and private) processed.
- Specifies where the information is processed.
- Identifies who has authorized access to the information.

### 9.2.9 Stakeholder Communication Facts

Incidence response requires communication with multiple people, both internal and external to the organization. Because of the sensitivity of any incident, it is important to know what reports need to be created and to whom the reports need to be given. The type of breach will dictate who should be informed and how long you have to inform them.

This lesson covers the following topics:

- Incident declaration and escalation
- Communication plan
- Stakeholder management

#### Incident Declaration and Escalation

Incident declaration and escalation are critical components of incident response. It is the process of recognizing and officially declaring an event as an incident, as well as the process of escalating the incident to the appropriate personnel.

The first step in incident declaration and escalation is identifying an incident, such as recognizing a potential security event and confirming that it constitutes a verified security incident. The category of "incident" is broad and includes everything from full-scale data breaches to something as simple as a protected document printed inappropriately. After identifying and confirming a security incident, the next step is the official declaration of the event as an incident. Incident declaration includes documenting the incident details, including its severity, and notifying the appropriate personnel via escalation procedures.

Depending on the type of incident, there may be multiple escalation levels. For instance, in a data breach, the incident may need to be escalated to executive management. Alternatively, if the incident is an attempted intrusion, it may need to be escalated to IT staff or a security operations center. An incident must be declared or escalated to the appropriate personnel for it to be properly addressed. Unaddressed incidents will likely result in significant future issues, jeopardizing the organization's security.

#### Communication Plan

A secure method of communication between the IR team members is essential for successfully managing incidents. The team may require "out-of-band" or "off-band" channels that attackers cannot intercept. In a major intrusion incident, using corporate email or VoIP runs the risk that the adversary can intercept communications. One obvious method is via smartphones, but ideally, the messaging system should support end-to-end encryption, digital signatures, and encryption keys supplied by a system independent of the identity and access management systems used by the attacked environment.

Once a security incident has occurred, communication is key to carrying out the plans your organization has developed for such cases. Having a set process for escalating communication will facilitate the knowledge and teamwork needed to resolve the incident and bring the organization's operations back to normal. The IR team should have a single point of contact to handle requests and questions from stakeholders outside the incident response team, including both executives within the company and contacts external to the company.

Steps must be taken to prevent the inadvertent release of information beyond the team authorized to handle the incident. Status and event details should be circulated on a need-to-know basis and only to trusted parties identified on a call list. Trusted parties might include both internal and external stakeholders. It may not be appropriate for all members of the IR team to be informed about all incident details.

It is imperative that adversaries not be alerted to detection and remediation measures about to be taken against them. It is harmful to publicize an incident in the press or through social media outside of planned communications. Ensure that parties with privileged information do not release it to untrusted parties, whether intentionally or inadvertently.

#### Stakeholder Management

Stakeholders describe any individual, group, or organization that can affect, be affected by, or perceive itself to be affected by a decision, activity, or outcome relating to an incident. Identifying stakeholders is the first step toward successful stakeholder management, as they are not always obvious. It is vital to identify, analyze, and prioritize stakeholders' perspectives, informational needs, expectations, and interests. These will dictate the communication methods and the content of the message.

After identifying stakeholders, it is essential to develop effective communication strategies to address their needs and interests. Building strong relationships with stakeholders is crucial and is accomplished by providing accurate and timely information, listening to feedback, and responding to requests. Effective communication helps to manage expectations, resolve conflicts, and foster collaboration.

Regular communication with stakeholders should be part of the incident response process to ensure they know the status of the incident. The method of communication depends upon the stakeholder and could include face-to-face meetings, emails, text/chat messages, telephone calls, or video conferencing. The sensitive nature of the incident response requires that employees use secure, approved methods of communication. Incidents impact stakeholders, and their areas of responsibility may be shaped by their knowledge of the incident. Keeping stakeholders informed helps them manage their responsibilities (affected by the incident). It often reveals information the responders may not have previously known, such as alternative processes, business relationships, impacts, and consequences.

Leveraging the communication plan, incident responders must coordinate between internal departments and external agencies, such as law enforcement and regulators. The following are some examples of internal and external stakeholders that will likely be relevant to any incident response.

The following table provides a list of internal stakeholders:

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Legal department</td>
    <td>
      Depending on the nature of a security incident, you may need to
      involve an attorney or a legal team. Involve the legal team when
      there are:
      <ul>
        <li>Compliance issues</li>
        <li>Regulatory violations</li>
        <li>Potential lawsuits</li>

  <tr>
    <td>Public relations</td>
    <td>
      The public relations team manages external communications to avoid
      or reduce negative publicity. They develop press releases,
      participate in media interviews, communicate with the organization's
      customers or constituents, and perform many other tasks. Public
      relations specialists are skilled at delivering "just enough"
      information and must often balance legal, ethical, and public
      interests.

The following video discusses the importance of incident response reporting and communication.

Executing Incident Response 00:00-06:38
James Stanger: Communication during an incident is so important, the level, the maturity of it, and to tell us more about how to have really good communication during an incident, we've brought in Jamie Williams. Jamie, how are you doing?

Jamie Williams: Great. How are you?

James Stanger: Doing great. Doing great. Jamie works for Mitre, he's the Principal Adversary Emulation Engineer at Mitre, which is a fantastic title. Jamie, let's talk about what it means to kinda work with all the different stake holders, and have a really good incident response kind of reporting situation. Tell us what it means to go about it the right way.

Jamie Williams: So, during an incident, obviously, you know, it's a panic. You know, if something bad's happened, we're trying to assess the situation, not only are we trying to understand what happened, but like, why did it happen? How did it happen? Where did it happen? When did it happen? But also, I think one of the biggest lessons is understanding that this isn't just a community-- oh wow.

Biggest lessons is understanding this isn't just a computer security problem, you know, we're not just looking at this from a Texan area where, you know, all the techys are on it, they're doing-- fixing things, [LAUGHTER] and we're gonna move on.

There's so many more stake holders in terms of, you know, I mean, affected parties, the business, anyone kind of in that bubble. And again, to your point, the way you communicate there is gonna be different. You know, the way I talk to the engineering staff, or the system owners, it maybe affected data, you know, there's a data breach or something...

James Stanger: Sure.

Jamie Williams: ...those affected parties, that kind of, you know, I'm not saying you're gonna withhold information but, you know, the way you communicate and the data points they might be interested in, are gonna be a little bit different. So it's a really delicate balance of building that core nuclear store...

James Stanger: Yeah.

Jamie Williams: ...documenting and understanding, here's everything we need to know, and then, you know, who's involved, and what do they need to know? What kind of insights do they need, 'cause again, our bigger picture is not to just, you know, point fingers and, you know, cast this as a huge failure, but to understand collectively where are we, where we need to be, and how can everyone help us get back to a good place?

James Stanger: So, as you declare this incident and escalate it, there are those different stake holders, for example, if there's a school involved, there are various stake holders, whether it be management, the people, the principal, the district superintendent, the school teachers, the students, the students parents, right? These are all examples of stake holders, right?

Jamie Williams: Exactly, and that is it. That's the worry in the way you communicate that, is gonna change for every one of those. You know, the principal is gonna need to be armed with things to communicate with. The superintendents gonna have, you know, a bunch of legal stuff to deal with. The students, and the parents, and the teachers, they're all gonna be potentially affected, and so, there's that instilling trust to make sure they understand, you know, we're not gonna hide behind a sugar coated language and say nothing bad happened.

We're gonna be real and tell you exactly what happened, but instill that trust of, you know, we're handling it, here's where we're going, is this okay with you? Is there anything maybe we need to consider? There might be, you know, really good insights that they have in terms of things that, you know, someone's computer security perspective we didn't notice. Maybe additional activity, or other insights that they might have experienced, that can maybe paint that bigger picture.

But, again, it's arming of those stake holders and of those parties with enough knowledge so that we're all collectively moving in the right direction. But also again, to your point, agreeing on that. Where maybe we think we have a good plan, we communicate it out, and we're getting feedback, where maybe there's regulations we weren't aware of. Maybe there is insights and considerations from the teachers that we didn't consider.

So really, again, treating this like an "us" problem that we can all collectively solve, versus let's divide and conquer and, every man for themselves.

James Stanger: You know, once we determine that impact, you know okay, I like to look at it in terms of, not only was there a, what? You know, whatever that incident that was, but the, so what? You know well, here's what the impact, here's the scope, here's what's happening. 'Cause then that does determine how you communicate, 'cause there are legal issues, right, that could be involved, if it's a school, for example. There are certain regulatory requirements out there, for example...

Jamie Williams: Yeah.

James Stanger: ...in this case that you'd have to make sure you follow.

Jamie Williams: Yep. And I love the way you painted that, so what? 'Cause there's, you know, there's immediate impact, in terms of, you know, maybe reporting requirements, regulation, disclosures, but there's also those residual long term impacts where maybe you lost some data, and it isn't immediately obvious where it's gonna go, but a year from now, two years from now, it might kinda come back and maybe we lost credentials, or we lost potential, you know, PPI, or anything like that.

James Stanger: Mm-hm.

Jamie Williams: Making sure, you know, you're not just closing the book too early and saying, you know, the incident's over, but really, you know, kinda forecasting and understanding, you know, we're not necessarily going to solve all these problems, but the more we can defend ourselves and be aware of them and keep everyone kind of in the right, you know, frame of mind, we can deal with these things and start to plan with them, maybe even before they happen.

So again, to your point, it's not necessarily-- we don't wanna treat this like

Whac-A-Mole where, you know, incident happens and we try to shove it back into this little hole as soon as possible. Let's really understand and take the time to carefully and craft-fully handle this so that, again, you know, there's gonna be no surprizes, or at least as few as possible.

James Stanger: Yeah, okay, so it comes down to kinda the level of maturity of your communications, right, how able you are to communicate? Part of that does include some technical terms that you may not use with all those audiences, but you'll have to kinda translate those for all your audiences. I'm talking about, you know, how long it took us to detect it, for example. Or, how long it'll take us to respond property, right? We call that, like, meantime to detect, or meantime to respond, but these are important metrics aren't they that you'll have to filter to various audiences, right?

Jamie Williams: Exactly, and I think the way it's filtered, and the way it's presented is gonna change by the audience. Where, again, thinking back to, what's your goal with communication? You know, if you're talking to the parents, and the students, and the teachers, they might not really care about meantime to respond, there might not...

James Stanger: Yes.

Jamie Williams: ...that term might not mean a lot, whereas you're talking to your IR team, and you could be blue team, and your detection engineers, that's the right audience. But again, you don't want to potentially hide that information too, because it might be relevant, it's just you kinda have to, exactly as you said, maybe re-cast it of, "Hey, you know, an incident happened on Monday, we noticed it on Wednesday," that's a quick and easy way to maybe paint that metric in a little bit more an accessible way...

James Stanger: Yeah.

Jamie Williams: ...but really to that point, kind of still being transparent and helping them understand what happened, and maybe potentially how they were impacted and considerations on their side.

James Stanger: Jamie, thank you so much for you insights about what incident response reporting really means. Sure appreciate it, man.

Jamie Williams: Thanks for having me.

James Stanger: Yeah.

### 9.2.10 Reporting Requirements Facts

This lesson covers reporting requirements and the necessity of notifying external parties when certain incidents—notably data breaches—occur. It is essential to identify breach types when assessing reporting requirements.

Notification requirements for different types of breaches are specified in legal and regulatory requirements and include a description of the parties to be notified and often include relevant regulatory bodies, law enforcement, private individuals, third-party organizations affected by the breach, and many others. For example, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) mandates reporting requirements using legislation and requires breach notification to affected individuals, the Secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services, and, if more than 500 individuals are impacted, to the media ( hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/breach-notification/index.html ).

The requirements also describe timelines for when parties must be notified. For example, under GDPR, the notification must be made within 72 hours after becoming aware of a personal data breach ( csoonline.com/article/3383244/how-to-report-a-data-breach-under-gdpr.html ).

Regulations also identify disclosure requirements for each affected party, such as a description of the breached information, details for the primary point of contact, expected consequences from the breach, and measures taken to mitigate the breach. A suspected breach should be treated as seriously as a known breach.

The following table identifies examples of breaches that may require outside reporting:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Breach</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>Data exfiltration</td>
  <td>
    Data exfiltration occurs when an attacker takes data stored inside a
    private network and moves it to an external network. Data
    exfiltration can be hard to prove because the information is not
    missing. It has only been copied. Even a suspected data exfiltration
    has similar regulatory notification requirements to an actual
    breach.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Insider data exfiltration</td>
  <td>
    An insider data exfiltration is the same as a data exfiltration
    except that it is performed by an employee, an ex-employee, or
    someone with authorized access and permissions to the system.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Integrity/availability</td>
  <td>
    Most data breaches impact the confidentiality of the information.
    Attacks that compromise the availability (destruction of
    systems-processing data) and integrity (modification of database
    records, for instance) are also likely to require regulatory
    notification and reporting.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Accidental data breach</td>
  <td>
    An accidental data breach usually happens because of employee error
    or a system misconfiguration. This leads to data being made public
    or sent to unauthorized recipients. This scenario has occurred more
    frequently as organizations use public cloud storage platforms for
    data. If the breach results in data being shared with unauthorized
    persons, the incident will probably need to be reported.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Device theft or loss</td>
  <td>
    If a device is lost or stolen, it should be reported. Even with
    encryption and strong authentication protecting it, device
    theft/loss must be treated as a suspected breach.
  </td>
</tr>

##### The following video explains the importance of vulnerability management reporting and communication.

Click one of the buttons to take you to that part of the video.

Importance of Vulnerability 00:00-11:16
James Stanger: Vulnerability management is successful if the reporting is successful. Let's talk about what it means to have high levels of communication, so that you could put together the right kind of plan to move forward. To learn more about this we've brought in MITRE's own Cat Self. Cat, how you doing?

Cat Self: Excellent. So grateful to be here.

James Stanger: Cat is the Adversary Emulation Engineer for MITRE. Cat tell us about your background, and then let's talk about what it means to do really good, high quality communication.

Cat Self: Communication, I feel like that's like the one skill, that like, everyone struggles to learn. [LAUGHS] Why is it like, no matter whether it's in your personal life or your professional life, the communication always is... a growing point.

James Stanger: It is, because you know, you've got vulnerability management reporting. It's like, well here's the vulnerability, here are the affected hosts, you know. You even have a risk score and all that stuff. So, once you've got that report and you could tell us a bit about kind of, what those reports look like, what are some of the next steps, or what are some of the nuances involved?

Cat Self: So two of your questions; one, background with communications. When I started in the army as military intelligence, one of my jobs was to be able to write reports. And that was a fun experience, in learning how to dumb things down [LAUGHS]. The reason why I was dumbing things down was because we were translating things in different languages. So, if you're working for an organization that has an international... what's the vocabulary word?

James Stanger: International component, or international audience?

Cat Self: So, if you're working for an organization that has an international audience, simplify. Even though I adjust and call it dumbing down, it's actually not. It's actually simplifying to what actually matters to communicate. When you actually simplify the communication, and you actually focus on like, what am I really trying to communicate here. Let's remove the filler words; let's remove the atmospherics, like, what is the point and what are they going to get from it. I think that's a really great exercise in order to write technical reports.

And that was something that I got to learn in the Army, was understanding who is the audience, who am I speaking to, and how are they going to use the information in which I am writing. So if I'm writing reports and I'm writing a beautiful flowery white paper, odds are only academics will read it.

James Stanger: That's right.

Cat Self: Right. But if I'm writing a report on like, hey, here's a walk-through. Is that walk-through targeted to people that are brand new in the industry? Or is that walk-through targeted to very deeply technical people? Where we're talking about the Kernel-level tracing of Linux Systems it's gonna be a very different writing. So with that said any type of vulnerability management also needs to take the audience into account.

James Stanger: Okay, once you've got that report together, okay, you have an action plan right? You know, where you've put together; hey we're gonna do some patching or some compensated controls, or whatever, it doesn't end there does it? Because there's usually something, some sort of road block or some sort of challenge that you have to work through. Is that about right?

Cat Self: Yes, that's absolutely right. So, the plan of action is so wonderful, as long as it takes into account reality. [LAUGHS] So, a lot of times we love these things that sound really good. We love these things with policy, love these things 'Well this is the way you should do it from an academic standpoint.' When it comes to application, life is messy, humans are messy. Systems are messier, which says a lot.

And let's just own the fact that most of these systems aren't brand spanking new. They're like tagged on ten years of like, this worked way back in the 70s, and since we don't wanna go back and pay the tech debt what we're gonna do is just, we're gonna wrap it with something else. And it's too expensive to move it from mainframe to something else.

So what we're gonna do is, we're gonna start up a brand new shiny system over here based on Dockerbut we're really gonna be pulling from main frame. We're not dealing with the same environment or same things. So, with that said, getting back to reporting: I apologize I lost a [UNSURE OF WORD].

James Stanger: No, this is good stuff because you're talking about working with systems that may not be as rational or as perfect as we like to think. So they're inhibitors right, to the remediation plan.

Cat Self: They are. So systems that are not ideal can be inhibitors. Technologies that are implemented can be inhibitors. Also time lines. release time lines. I think a lot of us forget about the fact that we're in this living, breathing organization where multiple teams are putting things into the environment. It is not the same as it was five seconds ago, 'cause there were 17 [poor] requests.

So what is that staging of rolling out deployments look like? We love to think, "Oh, everyone has a CI/CD pipeline." Like, we have this beautiful agile process, but if you read the Phoenix Project, which I absolutely recommend. It's actually one of my books that I make all of my people read. It's such a great book, you start to understand that like, this living breathing organization is very complicated, and so is rolling out some of these controls.

So, the time line of the reports very important, the considerations on when to deploy what is very important. And also the communication around providing resources. There's times that I wanted to implement, and they were implementing a security control. But they didn't have me available for the validation of that security control.

So I think there's actually a component there when you're rolling out these solutions, you also have to roll out the test of those solutions. A lot of times you don't account for the resources and the personnel, and then the pivoting context switching that you're requiring of those teams, to be able to loop back into something that they did, probably six to nine month ago.

So there was a situation where I was on the red team, I did this really cool thing where I got to basically manipulate this... vulnerability with a Microsoft Office product moving into a different folder and I would be able to launch an executable. I mean it was all based off a very specific version that was Outlook.

Well the problem was is that, if you upgraded Outlook right, it would break everything else. Six months later they ping me and they're like "Hey, we upgraded" and I'm like "Great [LAUGHS] I'm on an entirely different project now, I don't have time to go back and validate this test for you." And they're like, "Well, do you have any resources that we could pull to validate this test?" That was a much more complicated scenario than just like, click of a button.

And so we had to work through what does that process look like, to go back and validate some of these controls and behaviors, right? 'Cause the thing about vulnerabilities is that usually they're built on top of other things.

James Stanger: Sure.

Cat Self: They're chained. They're not just like, "Oh, and then I had�zero day." Usually if you actually break down zero days, they're a combination of multiple exploits. They jump to different parts of the hardware, to different parts of memory, then to deploy something else.

James Stanger: Various situations kinda layered on top of each other that you can then exploit, right?

Cat Self: Yeah. Google Tag has a phenomenal write-up of all the vulnerabilities that they find. I love following their blogs, because what they do is, they actually break down this vulnerability. That leads to this vulnerability, when then leads to this vulnerability, which then lead to this deployment of this back door. Right?

Like, that's how these things are layered. And so any behavior that you're trying to implement; calling out some of these vulnerabilities. I throw in behaviors cause they're a little bit more general than vulnerabilities, because vulnerabilities is gonna be very specific to patching.

But behaviors are usually where you're real goal is, because the reality is, if your door is open, cool, vulnerability, lock it. But I have a lock picking kit and my ultimate goal is just to get through your door, and here's all the variations of how I get to your door; like, what does that look like? Do you have detections for all the different ways that I can break into the door?

James Stanger: Love it. It's very helpful because from a behavior perspective, you're talking about now conditions and things; all the nuances involved, rather than just something that needs to be patched, right?

Cat Self: Yes, you'll actually find a lot of reporting. I actually found this very valuable in reporting; when they map things back to attack. So MITRE Att&ck, we've talked about this before, where it is a knowledge base of adversary behaviors observed in the wild. And it's all cited with open source intelligence.

So the point of this, and you'll find a lot of ping test reports, Red Team reports, Att&ck evaluations is what they do to be able to assess all of the vendors in the industry currently. They're all mapped back to Att&ck because Att&ck is a common language.

Like, those ways to be able to break in the back door, what is that? What are the different ways? They're like, we have lock picking, we have busting it open, right? Well, what does the rest of the industry call this? Do they call it lock picking, do they call it busting it open? No, we call it brute forcing. We call it valid accounts, right? We all want to be using the same language here.

James Stanger: You've gotta have a lingua franca, yeah.

Cat Self: Yes. How are we gonna address it if we're talking about two different things, and we're sitting at the table and we don't realize that we've talked about two different things the entire time, until the last five minutes. So much wasted time.

James Stanger: And that way, you can then move in to say, look, here's the vulnerability, here's the situation that we're in, right, and here's how we can work our way out of it, you know, with that action plan, right?

Cat Self: Yes. So the nice thing about when you're actually able to communicate what the vulnerability actually is, right; which we're definitely using vulnerability now back and forth between like, behavior and pattern. Because they can all relate but they are not the same.

There also is a whole component of, well what data sources do I have that map back to this? What visibility in the environment do I have to see? What controls should I put in place? Once controls are expected, what's the bare minimum here? And then what mitigations are there? And the nice thing about Att&ck and all of these things mapped back to a MITRE Att&ck is that it actually has those different identifiers listed out. And that will really help in like broadening the scope up.

Okay, when I pass this onto another team, have a given them the information they actually need in order to fix it. Because, just cause you have a report doesn't mean, again, back to that audience; what information did I give to that audience? Now give them a truly actionable plan. Did I define the actionable plan, or did they tell me what would make it an actionable plan for them?

James Stanger: It's a fantastic perspective. Cat, thank you so much for your perspective on vulnerability management reporting. Really appreciate it.

Cat Self: Absolutely, again, thank you so much for having me here.

James Stanger: You bet.

### 9.2.12 Detection and Analysis

Click one of the buttons to take you to that part of the video.

Detection and Analysis 00:00-00:19
The second stage of the Incident Response Process is detection and analysis. During this phase, the goal is to determine if an incident has taken place and perform triage to assess how severe the incident is. In this lesson, we'll first go over the detection phase and then look at how to perform the impact analysis.

Detection 00:19-01:22
Effective detection starts with the network monitoring systems we have in place. This can include the firewall, IDS and IPS, SIEM or SOAR systems, along with active monitoring from the security team. These systems are typically configured to actively detect and even handle lower-level threats. When a potential threat is detected, an alert is generated, which should be immediately investigated.

Insight into a potential security incident can come from a variety of locations. Logs gathered from applications, operating systems, and devices all provide detailed information about endpoint devices and network activity. The alerts from our security appliances will also provide details on the potential security threat. Non-technical resources such as internal and external individuals can alert you to the unusual activity they've witnessed or experienced. Public forums and security intelligence sites are also great resources for discovering new threats.

Once you've been alerted to a potential security incident, it must be investigated immediately. If it's determined that a threat does exist, an impact analysis should be performed.

Impact Analysis 01:22-01:40
Impact analysis involves determining how an incident might affect an organization. An incident's impact can be widespread and include compromised data and system resource integrity, unauthorized changes and configurations, stolen resources, the release of sensitive data, and system downtime.

Impact Categories 01:40-02:36
When a security incident is detected and confirmed, triage should be performed to determine the severity of the threat. Part of the triage process is to categorize the threat using either an impact-based or taxonomy-based approach to categorize the incident.

A taxonomy-based approach classifies the threat based on the type of incident, such as a DDoS, phishing attack, or even an internal attack. We can then define subcategories, such as who performed the attack or what attack vector was used to classify the threat further.

An impact-based classification will also reference these same categories, but the main classification here is the severity of the incident, such as severe, significant, moderate, or low.

We also need to categorize the scope of the incident. An organizational impact affects the organization's primary functions to the point that it can't continue operating normally. A local impact only affects a few systems, a single user group, or one department.

Incident Security Level 02:36-03:35
Impact categories are just one way to identify and analyze an incident. Incidents can be classified based on any number of measurable characteristics. The collective measure of all these factors determines an incident's security-level classification. Let's take a look at some of these factors.

An incident's detection time is the amount of time before the breach is detected. The longer it takes for an incident to be discovered, the higher the potential impact. The recovery time is the amount of time before an organization can recover from an incident. The longer it takes to recover, the higher the impact.

Downtime measures the amount of time an organization's business processes are slowed or disrupted. Downtime is detrimental to any organization, so the faster systems can be recovered and put back online, the better. Incidents that involve data integrity typically have a high impact, especially if a privacy breach is involved. System-process criticality is also a factor. If the impacted system is critical to business operations, the criticality level would be high.

Economic Impact 03:35-04:08
We can also classify incidents based on the economic impact. An incident's economic impact can be short or long-term. Short-term costs include incident response expenses and lost business. Long-term costs could include ongoing recovery costs or damage to reputation or market standing. Tangible costs can be easily identified and represent specific losses, such as damaged hardware, stolen passwords, and lost or corrupted data. Intangible costs are more difficult to pinpoint and represent a loss of potential customers because of downtime or damage to reputation.

Origin and Intent 04:08-04:55
Knowing an incident's origin and intent is important. If an attack is random or a matter of convenience, the security-level classification might be lower than if it were a targeted, intentional attack. If an attack were initiated by an organization or individual with a specific agenda, the threat level would be higher than if it were a widely distributed malware without a specific target.

Reverse-engineering an incident can help you determine the capabilities, intent, and possibly even the origin of the attack. The information you find during this process might point you to a known reported threat and its threat level.

When planning for the detection and analysis phase, you want well-documented courses of action supplemented by procedures and playbooks. You also want pre-determined methods for performing an impact analysis and measuring potential scenarios' criticality levels.

Summary: 04:55-05:29
That'll wrap up this lesson on detection and analysis. In this lesson, we first went over how our security appliances play a key role in detecting potential threats. Once an alert has been generated, it should be immediately investigated.

If a threat is detected, triage should be performed to classify the threat using a variety of categories, including impact categories, incident security levels, economic impact, and the origin and intent of the attack. Gathering this information helps us make better decisions on approaching a threat and taking care of it with the least impact on the business possible.

### 9.2.13 Detection and Analysis Facts

This lesson covers the following topics:

- Incident detection
- Impact analysis
- Incident security level classification

#### Incident Detection

The detection phase begins at the point you become aware of an attack. Security information and event management (SIEM) and intrusion detection systems (IDS) tools frequently form the foundation of incident detection capabilities, but detection techniques should cover a broad range of activities. IDS software may alert you of potential issues, or you may notice unusual activity while reviewing feedback provided by the IDS. Sometimes users will report a security issue. Sometimes detection begins with a discrepancy or oddity in an application that triggers a further investigation, or advanced techniques such as threat hunting may uncover malicious activity. Unlike full-blown malware infections that quickly overtake all systems, early detection of incidents (before they become catastrophic) can be challenging. Some issues or unusual activity may be harmless, but you should always investigate to rule out an attack.

The following list provides best practices for detection and analysis:

- Establish a baseline of normal user, network, and system activity. This will help you recognize changes.
- Synchronize all system clocks. This will ensure that logs can be easily cross-referenced when you review suspected activity.
- Filter information, especially if there are large quantities of information. This will help to reduce clutter.
- Establish a policy that specifies the information that should be logged. This policy should indicate the devices, systems, and applications that log data and how long to retain the logs.
- Capture packets as soon as you suspect an incident. This could provide important information about an attacker and the intent of the attack.

##### Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

SIEM helps security analysts perform data and log analysis to detect and investigate security incidents. SIEM solutions typically collect and analyze data from various sources, such as network devices, servers, applications, and security software, such as IDS/IPS and antimalware systems.

Specialized algorithms are a core feature of SIEM and help to identify suspicious patterns and anomalies in log data. For example, SIEM can detect suspicious login attempts, abnormal network traffic, or unusual system activity. SIEM also provides real-time alerts to security analysts when potential security incidents are detected, enabling them to investigate and respond to potential threats quickly. SIEM platforms can enrich vast amounts of simple text-based log data to provide useful and intuitive visualizations. Visualizations that include elements such as graphs, charts, trend lines, and colors are extremely valuable and help analysts more effectively locate and correlate important log events.

In addition to real-time monitoring, SIEM enables historical analysis of security logs and data so analysts can search and analyze historical log data to investigate security incidents that occurred in the past.

Detection methods depend on whether a threat is known or unknown—an attack with no precedent is challenging to identify promptly or may completely sidestep detection. In the analysis phase, separating false positives from actual indicators is critical. An alert or log entry may indicate something adverse has occurred, but this does not necessarily mean it results from an incident. Servers fail, workstations crash, and files change outside of established procedures.

A SIEM can generate huge numbers of alerts that need to be manually assessed for priority and investigation. Below is an example of a webpage with alerts. The alerts option is selected from the security menu on the left. The webpage is titled Alerts with a Manage rules button on the right. A tab below reads Open, Acknowledged, and Closed. Open is selected. The bar graph below the tab shows the Trend. A table below the bar graph lists the Actions, Time, Rule, Severity, Risk, Reason, host name, and user name.

#### Impact Analysis

Damage incurred in an incident can have wide-reaching consequences, including the following:

- Damage to data integrity and information system resources
- Unauthorized changes and configuration of data or information systems
- Theft of data or resources
- Disclosure or exfiltration of confidential or sensitive data
- Interruption of services and system downtime

After detecting an incident, a triage process should classify the incident based on an established classification framework. Categorization can use an impact-based or taxonomy-based approach. Taxonomy defines incident categories by types, such as worm outbreaks, phishing attempts, DDoS, external host/account compromise, or internal privilege abuse. The taxonomy includes subcategories such as attack vectors, threat actor type, etc. An impact-based approach can also reference these elements, but the incident's severity categorization—such as emergency, significant, moderate, and low—is the primary classification.

Impact analysis is the process of assessing what costs are associated with an incident, such as a data breach. It considers the scale of an incident by focusing on the number of systems infected or the percentage of users unable to access web services due to a DDoS attack. Impact analysis benefits from having the results of previous risk assessments and business impact analysis (BIA) assessments.

One way to approach impact analysis is to compare various categories of impact.

##### Organization Impact vs. Localized Impact

The scope of an incident is a straightforward way of assessing its impact.

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Category</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Local impact</td>
    <td>
      A localized impact means that the scope is limited to a single
      department, a small user group, or one or two systems.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Organizational impact</td>
    <td>
      An organizational impact affects an organization’s primary
      functions, meaning that the organization cannot operate as intended.
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Along with the scope, the duration of the impact will have a substantial effect on costs. From the perspective of incident response, the scope and duration of an event might not be obvious. It is important to reevaluate the impact as new facts emerge and to be prepared to escalate response procedures if the scope or duration seems likely to expand.

Conversely, the scope of an incident (broadly, the number of systems affected) is not necessarily a direct indicator of priority. Many systems might be infected with a type of malware that degrades performance but is not a data breach risk. This might even be a masking attack as the adversary seeks to compromise data on a single database server storing highly sensitive information.

##### Immediate vs. Total Impact

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Category</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>Immediate impact</td>
  <td>
    Immediate impact refers to direct costs incurred because of an
    incident, such as downtime, asset damage, fees, penalties, and other
    costs.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Total impact</td>
  <td>
    Total impact relates to costs that arise following the incident,
    including damage to the company's reputation and brand value.
  </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Incidents can be classified based on the following measurable characteristics.

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Characteristic</th>
  <th>Description</th>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>Detection time</td>
  <td>
    Time from the start of the attack until the breach is detected.

</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Recovery time</td>
  <td>
    Amount of time before an organization recovers from an incident.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Downtime</td>
  <td>
    Downtime measures the amount of time an organization’s business
    processes are slowed or disrupted.
  </td>
</tr>

  <td>
    Incidents in which a data breach is suspected or proven. Data
    integrity incidents are considered to have a high impact.
