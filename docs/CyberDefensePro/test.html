            Vulnerability assessments should be performed on the web server;
            these include:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Use CGI scanners or other vulnerability assessment programs.
              </li>
              <li>
                Review web server content, configuration, and log files to
                discover potential vulnerabilities.
              </li>
              <li>Check for hidden file extensions.</li>
              <li>
                Check the storage location of old backup and configuration
                files. These locations and old files can contain potential
                vulnerabilities.
              </li>
              <li>
                Perform file and directory enumeration to locate administrative
                interfaces that could be used to gain access to
                administrative-level permissions.

            Broken authentication refers to an app that allows an unauthorized
            user to access the app. Configuration errors that can cause broken
            authentication include:
            <ul>
              <li>The app allows weak passwords.</li>
              <li>
                The password reset function uses weak security or validation.
              </li>
              <li>The app is vulnerable to session hijacking.</li>
              <li>
                The app exposes credentials or authorization tokens to on-path
                attacks. This can happen because credentials are hard-coded into
                the app or encryption is not being used.
              </li>
              <li>
                Implementing access controls properly and regularly testing for
                vulnerabilities to mitigate the risk of exploitation is
                essential.

            Session management includes the following:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Ensure the cookies are sent only over a secure connection
                (HTTPS).
              </li>
              <li>
                Validate that the specified domain and the URL or path for the
                cookie are valid.
              </li>
              <li>
                Permit cookies to be accessed by HTTP but not other scripts such
                as JavaScript.
              </li>
              <li>Ensures that a cookie is deleted once it has expired.</li>
              <li>
                Use session fixation testing to verify that a session closes
                after a user has logged out or has been idle for a specified
                time.
              </li>
              <li>
                Check for exposed session variables to see how much data is left
                in the browser cache after the session closes.
              </li>
              <li>Look for any cross-site forgery request vulnerabilities.</li>
