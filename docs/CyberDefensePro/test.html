                    Exchange 2007's database engine is referred to as the
                    Extensible Storage Engine (ESE). ESE is a transactional
                    database that writes information into RAM memory and into a
                    log file. Once it is in the log file, it will be written to
                    disk. There are a number of files used to store information:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      An .edb file is located in the actual database itself. All
                      of a user's messages, folders, public folders, contacts,
                      appointment information, etc. is all stored on the .edb
                      file. An .edb file size can exceed multiple GB.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      A .log file is an ESE transaction log file. All .log files
                      are 1 MB.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      A .jrs file is a reserve log file which is used to commit
                      any transactions that are still in memory in the event of
                      the server running out of disk space. All .jrs files are 1
                      MB.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      A .chk file is used to identify which log files have been
                      committed to the database. The size of .chk file varies
                      from 2-3 KB.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    The ESE takes the following steps to write information into
                    database files:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      The ESE writes a message into memory RAM when it arrives
                      at the server.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      At the same time that information is written to RAM, it's
                      written into the current .log file. All current log files
                      are named E00.log. The information is written in a
                      sequential format until the log file is full. When the log
                      file is full, it will be renamed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Once it has been committed to the log file, the
                      information is written to the .edb file.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The checkpoint file is updated to indicate that the
                      transaction log that has been committed to the database.

                      The backup application will notify the database engine
                      that a backup is being started.

                    <li>

                    Routing algorithm in which each router broadcasts or
                    multicasts information regarding the cost of reaching each
                    of its neighbors to all nodes in the internetwork. Link
                    state algorithms create a consistent view of the network and
                    are therefore not prone to routing loops, but they achieve
                    this at the cost of relatively greater computational
                    difficulty and more widespread traffic (compared with
                    distance vector routing algorithms). Compare with distance

                    Linked mailboxes are used in environments in which there are
                    multiple forests (known as resource forests). When a linked
                    mailbox is created, a mailbox and a disabled user account
                    are created in the forest which hosts the Exchange
                    organization. Once the mailbox has been created, it is then
                    linked or associated with a user account that resides in the
                    second forest. In order to assign an account from the second
                    forest to the mailbox, a trust relationship must exist
                    between the domain that contains the Exchange server and the
                    domain in which the user account resides.

                    Mesh is a network topology that exists when there are
                    multiple paths between any two nodes on a network. Mesh
                    topologies are created using point-to-point connections.
                    This increases the network's fault tolerance because
                    alternate paths can be used when one path fails. Two
                    variations of mesh topologies exist:

                    In the Exchange 2007 messaging environment, messages are
                    placed in queues as they wait to be sent. Queues are stored
                    in an Extensible Storage Engine (ESE) databases which reside
                    on Hub Transport servers. Exchange 2007 queues can hold up
                    to a million messages, so in the event of a Hub Transport
                    server failure, the database can be retrieved and mounted
                    onto another Hub Transport server, at which point the queued
                    messages will be sent to their recipients.

                    for early modems that described error detection techniques.
                    The standards were called MNP Class 2, Class 3, and Class 4.
                    This standard became popular with several modem
                    manufacturers

                    A mirrored volume stores data to two duplicate disks
                    simultaneously. It provides fault tolerance because if one
                    disk fails, data is preserved on the other disk, and the
                    system switches immediately from the failed disk to the
                    functioning disk to maintain service. Mirrored volumes:

                    reconverts the signal back to digital form.

                    In this Windows NT domain model, user accounts are
                    distributed among more than one master domain and the
                    domains communicate via trust relationships. In this model a
                    user can log on from any domain because pass-through
                    authentication sends the request to the user's home domain.
                    This model is typically used for large companies that want
                    centralized administration. Each network user account is
                    created in one of the master domains. Other domains in the
                    network are resource domains, which are usually created at
                    the department level.

                    you can use several different character sets, as well as
                    binary data.

                    In multitasking operating systems, the processor is
                    time-sliced across tasks, devoting a certain amount of
                    processing time to each task. The processor then alternates
                    between tasks until they have all been completed. This
                    process occurs so rapidly that the computer appears to be
                    working on multiple tasks at one time.

                    Network-Attached Storage (NAS) is another method of adding

                    A node is a device that acts as a connection point within a
                    network. Nodes can be used for redistributing or forwarding
                    data or providing services to other devices or programs.
                    Node and host, in the network context, are often used
                    interchangeably.

                    Wireless networks require antennas for sending and receiving
                    transmitted signals. An omni-directional antenna disperses a
                    radio frequency wave in an equal 360-degree pattern. This
                    type of antenna is used to provide access to many clients in
                    a radius.

                    periodically exchanges routes to known networks among

                    Out-of-band management uses communication channels and
                    methods that are different from those used by the server to
                    communicate with normal network clients. With out-of-band
                    management, you separate server management traffic from
                    normal network traffic. You might also use unique tools that
                    allow you to communicate with a server before the operating
                    system loads or if the server is unresponsive to normal
                    network communications.

                    A packet filtering firewall filters packets based on source
                    and destination addresses, ports, and service protocols.
                    This type of firewall uses ACLs or filter rules to control
                    traffic. It operates at OSI layer 3 (Network layer), Offers
                    high performance because it only examines addressing
                    information in the packet header and it is subject to DoS
                    and buffer overflow attacks.

                    A packet switched network allows data to be broken up into
                    packets. Packets are transmitted along the most efficient
                    route to the destination. Packet switching is ideal for
                    transmitting data that can handle transmission delays, as is
                    often the case with Web pages and e-mail.

                      Rather than a shared bus, each PCIe slot links to a switch
                      which prioritizes and routes data through a point-to-point
                      dedicated connection and provides a serial full-duplex
                      method of transmission.

                      PCI Express is a serial communications channel made up of
                      two differential wire pairs that provide 2.5 GB/s in each
                      direction. Up to 32 of these lanes may be combined in x2,
                      x4, x8, x16 and x32 configurations, creating a parallel
                      interface of independently controlled serial links,
                      providing up to 4GB/s transfer speeds.

                      The slots are different lengths because of the different

                    PPPoE is a variation of Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) that
                    sends PPP packets over an Ethernet network and an "always
                    on" WAN link (DSL or cable modem, for example) rather than
                    over a dial-up connection. In this way, Internet service
                    providers can install PPP-based remote access servers and
                    require remote clients to establish a connection before
                    being granted access to the Internet. This lets Internet
                    usage be better tracked and regulated. PPP over Ethernet
                    automatically discovers the remote access server using
                    broadcast messages.

                    Poison message queues are used to isolate messages that
                    contain potentially harmful errors caused by an Exchange
                    2007 system failure. This queue is only viewable in the case
                    that such messages have been directed to the poison message
                    queue. Delivery of all messages within the poison message
                    queue is suspended. If a message is deemed unharmful, it
                    will be passed to the submission queue. All other messages
                    within the poison message queue are deleted.

                    Using the split horizon with poison reverse method (also
                    called poison reverse or route poisoning), routers continue
                    to send information about routes back to the next hop
                    router, but advertise the path as unreachable. If the next
                    hop router notices that the route is still reachable, it
                    ignores the information. If, however, the path timeout has
                    been reached, the route is immediately set to unreachable
                    (16 hops for RIP).

                    Network ports are logical connections, provided by the TCP
                    or UDP protocols at the Transport layer, for use by
                    protocols in the upper layers of the OSI model. The TCP/IP
                    protocol stack uses port numbers to determine what protocol
                    incoming traffic should be directed to. &nbsp;Some ICANN
                    specified categories for ports are listed below:

                      assigned for specific protocols and services.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                      are specifically assigned, by ICANN, for newly created
                      network services.

                      establishes contact and released when the session ends.

                    digital signals into analog for transmission via POTS.
                    Newer, better, and faster methods are quickly replacing POTS
                    as a signal transport medium.

                    PPPoE is a variation of Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) that
                    sends PPP packets over an Ethernet network and an "always
                    on" WAN link (DSL or cable modem, for example) rather than
                    over a dial-up connection. In this way, Internet service
                    providers can install PPP-based remote access servers and
                    require remote clients to establish a connection before
                    being granted access to the Internet. This lets Internet
                    usage be better tracked and regulated. PPP over Ethernet
                    automatically discovers the remote access server using
                    broadcast messages.

                    Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) is a very important

                    RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) is
                    primarily used for pre-authenticating remote clients before
                    access to the network is granted. RADIUS maintains client
                    profiles in a centralized database. It offloads the
                    authentication burden for dial-in users from the normal
                    authentication of local network clients. For environments
                    with a large number of dial-in clients, RADIUS provides
                    improved security, easier administration, improved logging,
                    and less-performance impact on LAN security systems.

                    The primary benefit of RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In
                    User Service) can be summarized as
                    <i class="fs-italicize">centralized</i>. RADIUS is a
                    centralized database of user access profiles. User access
                    profiles determine the rules and restrictions dial-in users
                    must comply with to establish a dial-up link to the network.
                    Only after satisfying the criteria enforced by RADIUS is a
                    remote client granted access to the network.

                    Recomputation is the process of a router comparing routes in
                    search for a new successor route. Recomputation occurs when
                    a successor route to a destination goes down and there are
                    no feasible successors for the destination.

                    In a recursive query, a name server uses its own resources
                    to resolve the request. A client sends a name resolution
                    request to a server. If it has the information, it sends the
                    results back to the client. If it does not have the
                    information, it passes the request to another server. A
                    server can answer a recursive request with either the
                    requested information or an error message. It cannot refer
                    the client to another server.

                    In a broad sense, remote access is access to a local area
                    network from home or some other place that is not directly
                    connected to the LAN. More specifically, remote access is
                    remote networking for mobile workers or system
                    administrators who manage servers at multiple location.
                    Windows 2000 and Network and Dial-up Connections let users
                    access networks remotely for such services as file and
                    printer sharing, electronic mail, and database access.
                    Remote access is part of the integrated Routing and Remote
                    Access service.

                    RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) is
                    primarily used for pre-authenticating remote clients before
                    access to the network is granted. RADIUS maintains client

                    authentication burden for dial-in users from the normal
                    authentication of local network clients. For environments

                    improved security, easier administration, improved logging,
                    and less-performance impact on LAN security systems.

                    The primary benefit of RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In
                    User Service) can be summarized as
                    <i class="fs-italicize">centralized</i>. RADIUS is a
                    centralized database of user access profiles. User access
                    profiles determine the rules and restrictions dial-in users
                    must comply with to establish a dial-up link to the network.
                    Only after satisfying the criteria enforced by RADIUS is a
                    remote client granted access to the network.

                    Remote delivery queues hold messages that will be delivered
                    using SMTP to recipient mailboxes that reside on remote
                    servers in Exchange 2007. Each remote delivery queue holds
                    messages that are routed to recipients with the same
                    delivery destination. Each time multiple recipients have the
                    same delivery destination, a remote delivery queue is
                    dynamically created. Once the messages have been
                    successfully delivered, the queue expires and is
                    automatically deleted three minutes later.

                    Internet. TCP/IP standards, however, are developed by
                    consensus. Member of the Internet Society can submit a
                    document to be published as an RFC. After submittal, the
                    document is reviewed for technical accuracy and assigned a
                    classification. There are five classifications of RFCs,
                    including Required, Recommended, Elective, Limited Use, Not
                    Recommended. If a document is being considered as a
                    standard, it goes through stages known as maturity levels.
                    These levels include proposed standard, draft standard, and
                    Internet standard.

                    Some applications provide the ability to implement security
                    based on connecting host names. When a request is made to
                    access a particular application, the application can contact
                    the DNS server and do a reverse lookup on the client's IP

                    A series of documents regarding TCP/IP standards. RFCs
                    describe the internal workings and processes of the
                    Internet. TCP/IP standards, however, are developed by
                    consensus. Member of the Internet Society can submit a
                    document to be published as an RFC. After submittal, the
                    document is reviewed for technical accuracy and assigned a
                    classification. There are five classifications of RFCs,
                    including Required, Recommended, Elective, Limited Use, Not
                    Recommended. If a document is being considered as a
                    standard, it goes through stages known as maturity levels.
                    These levels include proposed standard, draft standard, and
                    Internet standard.

                    A ring topology connects neighboring nodes until they form a
                    ring. Signals travel in one direction around the ring. In
                    ring topologies, each device on the network acts as a
                    repeater to send the signal to the next device. With a ring:

                    Route aggregation allows the aggregation of specific routes
                    into a single route in BGP. When route aggregation is
                    implemented without any modifiers, granularity is lost
                    because there is no inheritance of the individual route
                    attributes (such as AS_PATH or community).

                    Using the split horizon with poison reverse method (also
                    called poison reverse or route poisoning), routers continue
                    to send information about routes back to the next hop
                    router, but advertise the path as unreachable. If the next
                    hop router notices that the route is still reachable, it
                    ignores the information. If, however, the path timeout has
                    been reached, the route is immediately set to unreachable
                    (16 hops for RIP).

                    A Rendezvous Point (RP) is a temporary connection between a
                    multicast receiver and an existing shared multicast tree.
                    When a volume of traffic crosses a threshold, the receiver
                    is joined to a source-specific tree, and the feed through
                    the RP is dropped.

                    A Storage Area Network (SAN) is an out-of-the-computer

                    being connected inside of a server (known as Direct Attached
                    Storage (DAS)), storage devices are instead connected to the
                    network and then associated with one or more servers. SANs
                    allow for greater capacity storage than is possible with
                    DAS, and support high data transfer rates and clustering to
                    provide high availability.

                    SSH (Secure Shell) is a secure and acceptable alternative to
                    remote control systems such as Telnet. SSH allows for secure
                    interactive control of remote systems. SSH uses RSA public
                    key cryptography for both connection and authentication. SSH
                    uses the IDEA algorithm for encryption by default, but is
                    able to use Blowfish and DES.

                    packets called segments. Segmentation is necessary to enable
                    the data to meet network size and format restrictions. The
                    other function of segmentation happens when the receiving
                    Transport layer uses packet sequence numbers to reassemble
                    segments into the original message.

                    A session refers to a communication between two end points
                    (usually between client and service) that occur during a
                    single connection. The session begins when the connection is
                    established at both ends and terminates when the connection
                    is ended.

                    Twisted pair cables support a wide variety of fast, modern
                    network standards. Twisted pair cabling is composed of&nbsp;
                    two wires that carry the data signals. PVC plastic
                    insulation surrounds each wire. Two wires are twisted to
                    reduce the effects of electromagnetic interference and
                    crosstalk. Because the wires are twisted, EMI should affect
                    both wires equally and can be cancelled out. Multiple wire
                    pairs are bundled together in an outer sheath. Twisted pair
                    cable can be classified according to the makeup of the outer
                    sheath. Shielded Twisted Pair (STP) has a grounded outer
                    copper shield around the bundle of twisted pairs or around
                    each pair. This provides added protection against EMI.

                    to report the status of a host on a Windows TCP/IP network.
                    Network equipment vendors developed SNMP to let management
                    software monitor network components. Using SNMP, programs
                    called agents are loaded on to each network component. The
                    agents monitor network traffic and other network components
                    and compile the information in a management information base
                    (MIB). Windows 2000 uses SNMP to check the status of another
                    computer on a TCP/IP network.

                    Simplex and duplex are methods of communication
                    transmission. Simplex is the one-way transmission of a
                    signal across a medium. Duplex is the two-way transmission
                    of a signals across a medium. There are two types of duplex
                    transmission; half-duplex and full-duplex. Half-duplex
                    allows transmission of signals, one party at a time.
                    Full-duplex allows transmission and reception of signals to
                    occur concurrently.

                    updates to other domain controllers. Windows NT 4.0 used
                    this replication model.

                    A TCP/IP subnet or group of well connected subnets. If

                    In Windows 2000, a site is a physical unit that defines
                    replication for Active Directory informatioon. Each site
                    includes one or more servers within an organization. To be
                    in the same site, servers need permanent, high-speed LAN or
                    WAN connections to each other.

                    A simple protocol for managing TCP/IP networks. It is used
                    to report the status of a host on a Windows TCP/IP network.
                    Network equipment vendors developed SNMP to let management
                    software monitor network components. Using SNMP, programs
                    called agents are loaded on to each network component. The
                    agents monitor network traffic and other network components
                    and compile the information in a management information base
                    (MIB). Windows 2000 uses SNMP to check the status of another
                    computer on a TCP/IP network.

                    Social engineering is an attack where someone claims to be
                    someone other than who they are. Attackers can assume any
                    role within your organization or of anyone outside of your
                    organization. Their goal is to get you to disclose
                    confidential or sensitive information verbally or to perform
                    some action on the computer system that would grant the
                    attacker access, such as changing a password based on a
                    verbal request over the phone by someone claiming to be an
                    offsite manager. Some common social engineering attacks are:

                    The primary countermeasure to social engineering is
                    awareness. If users are unaware of the necessity for
                    security in your organization and they are not properly
                    trained to support and provide security, they are vulnerable
                    to numerous social engineering exploits. Awareness training
                    focused on preventing social engineering should include
                    methods to authenticate personnel over the phone, assigning
                    classification levels to information and activities, and

                    Using the split horizon method (also called best
                    information), routers keep track of where the information
                    about a route came from. Routers do not report route
                    information to the routers on that path. In other words,
                    routers do not report information back to the router from
                    which their information originated.

                    Using the split horizon with poison reverse method (also
                    called poison reverse or route poisoning), routers continue
                    to send information about routes back to the next hop
                    router, but advertise the path as unreachable. If the next
                    hop router notices that the route is still reachable, it
                    ignores the information. If, however, the path timeout has
                    been reached, the route is immediately set to unreachable
                    (16 hops for RIP).

                    network and to distinguish these devices from other adjacent

                    A static route is a route that is manually configured to a
                    remote destination. They can be used to reduce overall
                    traffic because they do not require information to be

                      must be exchanged between two autonomous systems. This
                      eliminates the need for entire routing tables to be

                    A Storage Area Network (SAN) is an out-of-the-computer
                    storage option for large systems. Instead of storage devices
                    being connected inside of a server (known as Direct Attached
                    Storage (DAS)), storage devices are instead connected to the
                    network and then associated with one or more servers. SANs
                    allow for greater capacity storage than is possible with
                    DAS, and support high data transfer rates and clustering to
                    provide high availability.

                    Twisted pair cables support a wide variety of fast, modern
                    network standards. Twisted pair cabling is composed of&nbsp;
                    two wires that carry the data signals. PVC plastic
                    insulation surrounds each wire. Two wires are twisted to
                    reduce the effects of electromagnetic interference and
                    crosstalk. Because the wires are twisted, EMI should affect
                    both wires equally and can be cancelled out. Multiple wire
                    pairs are bundled together in an outer sheath. Twisted pair
                    cable can be classified according to the makeup of the outer
                    sheath. Shielded Twisted Pair (STP) has a grounded outer
                    copper shield around the bundle of twisted pairs or around
                    each pair. This provides added protection against EMI.

                    parts. The first part is used to identify the segment as a

                    hosts. Companies typically used subnetting because they

                    IP address.

                    Subnetting is the division of a network address into
                    multiple smaller subnets. For example, this allows a single
                    Class B or Class C addresses to be divided and used by
                    multiple organizations.

                    Thrashing is excessive paging. It occurs when the computer
                    spends too much time passing pages between physical memory
                    and the paging file on a hard drive. A symptom of thrashing
                    is that the CPU is under-used but the I/O system is working
                    exceptionally hard.

                    A tombstone marks the fact that someone deleted an object in

                    Instead, tombstones are replicated to servers to notify them
                    to delete these objects.

                    Transit AS peering is the communication of information
                    between all EBGP peers. This is optimal for scenarios in
                    which an ISP allows their customers using BGP to access all
                    their other customers using BGP.

                    responsible for reliable network communication between end
                    nodes. The transport layer provides mechanisms for the
                    establishment, maintenance, and termination of virtual
                    circuits, transport fault detection and recovery, and
                    information flow control. Corresponds to the transmission
                    control layer of the SNA model. See also application layer,
                    data link layer, network layer, physical layer, presentation
                    layer, and session layer.

                    With the triggered update method (also known as a flash
                    updates), routers that receive updated (changed) information
                    broadcast those changes immediately rather than waiting for
                    the next reporting interval. With this method, routers
                    broadcast their routing tables periodically, punctuated by
                    special broadcasts if conditions have changed. This method
                    reduces the convergence time.

                    Tunneling is used primarily to support private traffic
                    through a public communication medium. The most widely known
                    form of tunneling is VPN (Virtual Private Networking). A VPN
                    establishes a secured communications tunnel through an
                    insecure network connecting two systems.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Tunnels provide secure communications, they usually provide
                    less than optimal throughput due to the additional overhead
                    of encryption and maintaining the communications link.
                    Tunnels are not directly associated with password theft or
                    protection.

                    Servers track directory changes using Update Sequence
                    Numbers (USNs). Each server keeps track of the changes it
                    has already received or made. When a server requests changes
                    from another server, they compare USNs. If the numbers are
                    the same, neither server makes any changes. If one server's
                    number is higher than another, the server with the lower
                    number requests the changes corresponding to the higher
                    numbers.

                    In Windows 2000, a USN is a server-specific 64-bit counter
                    that increases each time that domain controller's Active
                    Directory database is updated. See also local update
                    sequence number and originating update sequence number.

                    Use a switch to create virtual LANs (VLANs). The various
                    ports on a switch can be assigned to a specific VLAN to
                    create logically distinct networks on the same physical
                    network topology.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    VLANs reduce the likelihood of traffic interception because
                    the switch creating the VLANs transmits traffic only over
                    the specific port hosting the intended recipient of a
                    message. Thus, eavesdropping on any given segment will
                    reveal only the traffic occurring on that specific segment
                    rather than from the entire network. VLANs decrease
                    broadcast traffic and allow the connection of geographically
                    separate systems into the same network. VLANs usually reduce
                    collisions.

                    A virus is the common name for a program that has no useful
                    purpose, but attempts to spread itself to other systems and
                    often damages resources on the systems where it is found.
                    Viruses are a serious threat to computer systems, especially
                    if they are connected to the Internet. It is often a minimal
                    requirement to have an anti-virus scanner installed on every
                    machine of a secured network to protect against viruses.

                    E-mail is the most common means of virus distribution. Often
                    viruses will employ self-contained SMTP servers to
                    facilitate self-replication and distribution over the
                    Internet. Viruses are able to spread quickly and broadly by
                    exploiting the communication infrastructure of Internet
                    e-mail. For this reason, it is important to keep your
                    anti-virus software updated so as to block any possible
                    attempt of viruses to infect your systems or to spread to
                    other systems from your system.

                    the disk. By enabling VSS, you can quickly back up and
                    restore files.

                    Sometimes called a VPN. A VPN is the extension of a private
                    network over a shared or public network such as the
                    Internet. It makes use of encrypted and authenticated links
                    that provide remote access and routed connections between
                    private networks or computers.

                    A warm site is a fault tolerant strategy which provides a
                    redundant work location. If a disaster renders a work site
                    unusable, the effected organization may have a warm site in
                    which to relocate. Warm sites have the following

                    WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) was designed to provide
                    wireless networks the same type of protection that cables
                    provide on a wired network. WEP requires that authorized
                    users have a valid WEP key to communicate with the access
                    point. Likewise, cables provide this type of protection in
                    that a client can only communicate with a hub or router if
                    they have an active network cable connected to them.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    On a wireless network that is employing WEP (Wired
                    Equivalent Privacy), only users with the correct WEP key are
                    allowed to authenticate through the WAP (Wireless
                    Application Protocol) access points. That's the whole point
                    of WEP, to prevent unauthorized users by employing a
                    wireless session key for access.

                    WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) was designed to provide
                    wireless networks the same type of protection that cables
                    provide on a wired network. WEP requires that authorized
                    users have a valid WEP key to communicate with the access
                    point. Likewise, cables provide this type of protection in
                    that a client can only communicate with a hub or router if
                    they have an active network cable connected to them.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    On a wireless network that is employing WEP (Wired
                    Equivalent Privacy), only users with the correct WEP key are
                    allowed to authenticate through the WAP (Wireless
                    Application Protocol) access points. That's the whole point
                    of WEP, to prevent unauthorized users by employing a
                    wireless session key for access.

                    Wireless networking uses radio waves or infrared light (with
                    the air as the transmission medium) to send data between
                    hosts. Wireless networks are common in homes, businesses,
                    airports, and hotels. Most wireless networks connect into
                    larger wired networks (such as LANs) which are in turn
                    connected to the Internet.

                    With Zeroconf, you should be able to connect two computers
                    and automatically have them be able to communicate. You
                    should also be able to set up a small network (even a
                    network with multiple subnets or connected to the Internet)
                    by simply connecting devices and without performing any
                    additional configuration tasks.

                    A portion of the DNS namespace made up of a single domain or

                    A particular name server is responsible for each zone. The
                    name server stores all address mappings for the domain name
                    space with the zone. It also answers client queries for
                    those names.

                    The process of replicating updates to the zone information
                    among multiple DNS servers. Regular zone transfers are
                    necessary because as computers and other devices are added
                    to or removed from a network, host names and IP addresses
                    change.
