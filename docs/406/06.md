# Module 10: Centralized and Decentralized System Recovery

## Objective

Labs in this module demonstrate centralized backup and restoration techniques for virtual machines. In virtual environment, it is essential to have a centralized architecture in order backup the all the virtual machines at once. Regular backups must be taken in a production environment where substantial time and money is saved by using the centralized backup and restoration technique.

## Scenario

What if all the virtual servers in a virtualization platform get corrupted? It can result in the loss of all the production data bringing the production to a grinding halt. In this scenario, we can recover all the virtual servers by employing the centralized backup and restoration technique. In centralized backup and restore, all the backup files of the VMs running in a particular virtualization platform, are stored in a central location. In the event of a disaster, the lost VMs are restored by the backup available at the central location. Instead of performing restoration task of lost VMs one by one, we can restore all the VMs at once using various centralized backup tools.

# Centralized Backup of Virtual Machines using ArCycle Tool

## Scenario

ArCycle is a specific software designed to take the backups of the virtual machines using various virtualization platforms like Hyper-V and V-Sphere. It is a very useful tool to take centralized backups of virtual machine over to a storage network like NAS.

**Lab Scenario**

This lab focuses on performing a centralized backup of VM’s instances. A centralized backup is a process in which data is replicated to remote sites and sending it over a network to a centralized location for storage. Centralized backup automates the backup at remote sites and reduces the backup administration cost and time. As a network administrator, you should be able to conduct centralized data backup and restoration of the virtual machines.

**Lab Objectives**

This lab demonstrates how to conduct centralized backup of a virtual machines in a controlled environment using ArCycle tool.
