# Module 03: Risk Assessment

## Objective

Labs in this module demonstrate Qualitative Risk Assessment. Risk assessment is a structured process by which risks are identified and evaluated. In the context of Business Continuity Planning (BCP), it enables an organization to understand the potential threats to its most critical resources and processes. By anticipating the potential impacts that risks can have, an organization can manage and mitigate the risks. As a disaster recovery professional you should know how to perform risk analysis using various tools like PILAR Basic.

## Scenario

In any organization, it is very important to perform a Qualitative Risk Assessment to identify and analyze the possible risk event and its impact if and when it occurs. Qualitative Risk Assessment works on relative or descriptive measures to analyze the probability of the risk occurring. In a qualitative analysis, likelihood or probability is measured using a relative scale using terms such as low, moderate, high. Risk assessment gives an insight towards security and integrity of different aspects of IT infrastructure of an organization.

## Qualitative Risk Assessment using PILAR Risk Management Tool

### Scenario

Qualitative risk assessment is the process of using non-numerical based methods to identify and analyze the risk event and its impact if and when it occurs. It works on relative or descriptive measures to analyze the probability of the risk occurring.

### **Lab Objectives**

This lab demonstrates how to perform a Qualitative Risk Assessment using PILAR Risk Management Tool.

**Lab Scenario**

This lab focuses on performing a Qualitative Risk Assessment using **PILAR Risk Management Tool**. Qualitative Risk Assessment is the process of using non-numerical based methods to identify and analyze the risk event and its impact if and when it occurs. It works on relative or descriptive measures to analyze the probability of the risk occurring. In a qualitative analysis, likelihood or probability is measured using a relative scale using terms such as low, moderate, high, and so on. As a disaster recovery professional, you must know how to perform Qualitative Risk Assessment in order to understand the potential threats to most critical aspects, supports resources and their potential impact if any disaster happens.
