# Module 08: Virtualization Based Disaster Recovery

## Objective

Labs in this module demonstrate various techniques for backup and restoration techniques for systems running in a virtual environment. Virtualization based disaster recovery helps in better protection of critical data stored in virtual machines. A disaster recovery professional should know how to quickly recover virtual machines using techniques such as: Checkpoint Restore and various VM recovery tools.

## Scenario

What if a virtual machine running on virtualization platform such as: Hyper-V; starts crashes? In this scenario, we can restore the state of the virtual machine with the help of Hyper-V checkpoints. Furthermore, we can also perform backup and recovery of the entire data stored in virtual machines by using various software tools. It helps in better protection of critical data stored in virtual machines in case of occurrence of any disaster.

# Backup and Restoration of the Virtual Machines using Hyper-V Checkpoint

## Scenario

Checkpoints are a feature of Windows Hyper-V which allows the restoration of a virtual machine back to a previous state. Creating a checkpoint is very helpful in quick recovery of a virtual machine.

**Lab Objectives**

This lab demonstrates how to conduct backup and recovery of a virtual machines using Hyper-V’s native Checkpoint feature.

**Lab Scenario**

The backup and restoration of the virtual machine is very much needed to protect the important data stored in the virtual machines and servers. It helps in better protection of critical data in case of occurrence of any disaster like scenario. Checkpoint is a native snapshot restoration option available for Windows Hyper-V platform. Checkpoints can preserve the state of the Virtual Machine running inside the Hyper-V. As a network administrator, you should be able to perform the task of data backup and restoration of the virtual machines using Checkpoints.
