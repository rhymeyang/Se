# Module 06: Data Backup Strategies

## Objective

Labs in this module demonstrate various strategies related to data backup. Data backup strategies mostly emphasize on the ways through which systems can be backed up and restored within a given RPO and RTO to minimize the impact of any disaster. As a disaster recover professional you should know various data backup strategies like Disk-to-Disk (D2D) backup and Data Deduplication in order to achieve quick and effective data backup and restoration.

## Scenario

For organizations which relies on data, it is a must for them to implement data backup strategies to protect their data. Data backup strategies must include various methods and plans to quickly perform data backups and recovery. If an organization is using Virtual Tape Library (VTL) architecture to back up data, then its RTO and RPO will increase by 2-3 times as compared to Disk-to-Disk backup. Also, more the volume of data, the more time it takes to back it up. By deduplication of data, we can free space on a volume by looking for duplicated portions. Data Deduplication optimizes redundancies without compromising data fidelity or integrity which results in faster backups due to smaller sizes.

# Backup and Restoration of Disk using Disk-to-Disk (D2D) Backup Strategy

## Scenario

Data backup and recovery from disks is much faster than tape. Storage and transportation of backed up data is more convenient and easier. In disk-to-disk backup strategy, the backup of a disk is created on a disk which speeds up the recovery process.

### Lab Objectives

This lab demonstrates how to backup and restore a disk using disk-to-disk (D2D) backup strategy.

### Lab Scenario

This lab focuses on performing a disk-to-disk backup. Disk-to-disk refers to backing up data from one hard drive to another. The source disk is known as the **primary disk** and the backup disk is known as the **secondary disk**. Both the disks in this scenario are portable. Data is usually backed up to a disk-based application or SATA/SAS array. D2D provides faster backup and recovery when compared to Virtual Tape Library.

    ![Screenshot](/images/406/406_02_229.jpg)

**Assessment 2:**

In the EDRP Windows Server 2012 Primary Server machine, install the **Data Duplication role** to perform a data duplication. Configure the date duplication on E: drive. Create folders like User1, User2, User3,… Upto 20 in the E: drive and copy the EDRP White Papers folder available at This PC\EDRP-Tools (Z:) in all the newly created folders. Use the data duplication feature using Windows PowerShell and observe the used space of E: drive before and after duplication. Enter the value OptimizedFiles field found in the result.
