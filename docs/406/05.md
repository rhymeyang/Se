# Module 09: System Recovery

## Objective

Labs in this module demonstrate various recovery techniques such as: system image and bare metal recovery, to restore systems running on different operating system like Windows Server 2012 r2, Windows Server 2016, Ubuntu and Windows 10. In production environment it is important to restore systems in given RPO and RTO to mitigate the impact of any disaster. A disaster recovery professional also know how to quickly recover the permanent lost data using various recovery tools.

## Scenario

What if a system running on Windows 10, or any other OS, after installing a particular software starts crashing? This might result in data files getting corrupted or even lost. In that particular scenario, we can recover the system’s corrupted files and lost data by performing system image restore. Furthermore, we can also recover just the previous state of the Operating System by performing system restore technique. Scenarios in system recovery depends upon the type of issue that particular system is facing.

# Restoration of a Windows 10 system using System Restore

## Scenario

System Restore is a native feature of Microsoft Windows 10, which enables the user to revert their computer's state, including: system files, installed applications, Windows Registry, and system settings to that of a previous point in time, which can be used to recover from system issues and data losses.

**Lab Objectives**

This lab demonstrates how use System Restore feature to revert the system files and settings.

**Lab Scenario**

System Restore is Windows 10 inbuilt feature to revert system changes by using restore points, which will allow the system files and settings to revert to an earlier point in time without affecting personal files of users. System Restore utilizes system protection feature which regularly creates and saves information about the drivers, programs, registry, system files, and settings as restore points. In case of an issue with Windows 10, we can use the System Restore to restore the previous state of Windows 10 to an earlier point in time which is a restore point.

1. To login Windows 10 machine, navigate to **Machines** pane and click Windows 10. Click **Ctrl+Alt+Delete** button under the Windows 10 machine thumbnail.

   > Alternatively you can navigate to **Commands** menu and click **Ctrl+Alt+Delete** to login.
