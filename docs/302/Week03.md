# Chapter 3: Security and Privacy in Intelligent Autonomous Vehicles

## OBJECTIVES

+ Overview
+ Cryptography Introduction
+ Cryptography Objective
+ Cryptographic Primitives
+ Cyber Security in Intelligent and Autonomous Vehicles

## OVERVIEW
+ The cyber security in intelligent and autonomous vehicles can be a combination of physical security, information security, security elements, policies, standards, legislation, and risk mitigation strategies.
+ We will introduce the updated cybersecurity framework that provides a specific categorization and structural framework for institutions to describe their current cybersecurity position, state for cybersecurity, identify and prioritize security improvements, assess security progress, and plan concerning cybersecurity risks.
+ Then, we discuss the five key technological cybersecurity to protect any company, organization, and IAV against cyber-attacks.
+ A threat modeling method (TMM) is also required to investigate the potential threats so that the IAV system is fully secured from unknown attacks.

Fig. 3.1 A basic encryption system

A cryptosystem has the following components:

+ Plaintext
+ Encryption algorithm
+ Ciphertext
+ Decryption algorithm
+ Encryption key
+ Decryption key

## CRYPTOGRAPHY OBJECTIVE

The primary purpose of cryptography is to guarantee the following four basic security services:

+ Confidentiality 
+ Data Integrity 
+ Authentication 
+ Non-repudiation

## CRYPTOGRAPHIC PRIMITIVES

Cryptographic primitives are the cryptographic algorithms used to build cryptographic
### Symmetric Key or Secret Key Encryption
