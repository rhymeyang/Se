- Challenges for Transportation Cyber-Physical System Adoption

## INTRODUCTION OF TRANSPORTATION CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEM

- Definition of **Cyber-Physical System** as perceived in the **United States**:

  - Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are integrations of computation and physical processes. Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa.

- Definition of **Cyber-Physical System** as perceived in **Europe**:

  - Cyber-Physical System are systems with embedded software (as part of devices, buildings, means of transport, transport routes, production systems, medical processes, logistic processes, coordination processes and management processes), which:

    - directly record physical data using sensors and affect physical processes using actuators;

    - evaluate and save recorded data, and actively or reactively interact both with the physical and digital world;

    - are connected with one another and in global networks via digital communication facilities (wireless and/or wired, local and/or global);

    - use globally available data and services;

    - have a series of dedicated, multi-modal human-machine interfaces.

## TRANSPORTATION CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEM FOR THE FUTURE OF MOBILITY: ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIETAL BENEFITS

+ Transport has the ability to act both as an **enabler** to tackle such challenges as mobility of the ageing population and disaster management whilst facilitating globalisation and development and as a contributor to such challenges as pollution, climate change, etc.
+ The transport sector is a major consumer of fossil fuels and hence a leading contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, with predictions showing that this sector will contribute to 30%-50% of all emissions by the year 2050.
+ The European Environmental Agency aims at reducing by 50% the number of vehicles running in conventional fuels such as diesel and petrol by 2030 and eliminating such vehicles by 2050.
+ Many of the TCPS solutions benefitting society by facilitating seamless travel, improved accessibility and enhanced safety are powered by the easy accessibility of data sources (such as data provided by public transport providers and data passively collected by mobile phone applications such as Google Maps); availability of faster, reliable and higher capacity communication networks; ubiquitous use of mobile phones and easy availability of processing power such as in the cloud.

## CHALLENGES FOR TRANSPORTATION CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEM ADOPTION



+ CPSs are developing very fast, fuelled by the availability of low-cost, low-power, high-quality sensors; abundant communication bandwidth and speed and increasing efficient computing devices.
+ However, this is a field that integrates expertise from a number of fields, such as control systems, communication networks, architecture, modelling and simulation, verification and validation, as well as human factors.
