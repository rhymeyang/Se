## When Should An Audit Happen?

Cybersecurity audits can be conducted at multiple stages in relation to an attack:

- **Before an Attack (Proactive Audits)**:

  - Regular, proactive audits are essential to identify vulnerabilities, gaps, and weaknesses in a system **before** a cyberattack occurs. These audits help prevent breaches by ensuring that security controls are in place and working as intended.

- **During an Attack (Incident Response Audits):**

  - Audits during an attack, though rare, can help assess the extent of the attack in real-time and identify the immediate steps necessary to mitigate damage. These may occur as part of an **incident response** process, helping organizations evaluate the attack vector and system breaches.

- **After an Attack (Post-Incident Audits):**
  - Audits conducted after an attack (known as post-mortem audits or forensic audits) aim to determine how the breach happened, what data or systems were affected, and how security measures can be improved to prevent future attacks.

## Who Are Auditors?

Auditors are professionals skilled in evaluating security measures, systems, and compliance. They can be selected based on several criteria:

- **Internal Auditors:**
  - **Internal auditors** are employed by the company and are familiar with the internal systems, policies, and processes. They conduct routine audits to ensure compliance and security. Internal audits are typically less formal and more frequent.
- **External Auditors:**
  - **External auditors** are independent third-party professionals or firms that specialize in cybersecurity and compliance. External auditors are brought in for formal audits, regulatory compliance assessments, or when independent verification is required. They offer unbiased evaluations and often have specialized certifications like **Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA)**.

## Internal Audit Team vs External Audit Team

- **Internal Audits:**

  - Usually conducted by in-house staff who are familiar with the company's operations, internal audits focus on continuous monitoring, identifying internal risks, and ensuring day-to-day compliance.

- **External Audits:**

  - When objectivity, regulatory compliance, or high-stakes certification is required, external auditors are hired. External auditors are especially critical for industries with strict regulations, like healthcare or finance, where certifications such as **ISO 27001** or **SOC 2** are needed.

## Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs)

- CAVs represent a significant advancement in automotive technology, integrating connectivity, automation, and data processing to enable smarter, safer, and more efficient transportation.
- **Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs)** are vehicles equipped with advanced connectivity and autonomous driving capabilities. These vehicles utilize a combination of sensors, artificial intelligence, and communication technologies to interact with their environment, other vehicles, infrastructure, and more. The main goal of CAVs is to enhance safety, improve traffic efficiency, reduce emissions, and offer a better user experience by automating driving tasks and optimizing routes.

## Understanding V2I, V2V and V2X

- V2I communication refers to the exchange of information between a vehicle and road infrastructure, such as traffic lights, road signs, and traffic management systems. This interaction helps improve traffic flow, enhance safety, and optimize the use of transportation networks.

> **Example**: Imagine you're driving a connected car approaching an intersection. The traffic light ahead is equipped with V2I technology. As you approach, your vehicle communicates with the traffic light system to determine whether it will turn red or green. The system can also adjust the timing of the lights to optimize traffic flow, reducing the likelihood of you having to stop. If the light is about to change, your vehicle receives a notification, allowing you to slow down gradually rather than braking abruptly.

---

- V2V communication allows vehicles to exchange information with each other directly. This information can include data about speed, position, direction, and other driving-related information. V2V communication is crucial for enhancing safety and preventing accidents.

> **Example**: You're driving on the highway when the car in front of you suddenly brakes due to an obstacle on the road. Thanks to V2V communication, your car instantly receives this information from the vehicle ahead and automatically starts braking even before you have time to react. This rapid exchange of data helps prevent rear-end collisions and other accidents.

---

- V2X communication is a broader term that encompasses both V2I and V2V, as well as communication with other entities like pedestrians (V2P), cyclists, and even the cloud. V2X is about creating a fully connected transportation ecosystem where vehicles interact with everything around them.

> Example: You're driving through a smart city where your vehicle communicates with not just other cars and traffic lights but also with the city's central traffic management system. The system gathers data from various sources, including weather forecasts and traffic conditions, to optimize your route in real-time. It may suggest alternate routes to avoid congestion or automatically adjust your speed to optimize fuel efficiency based on upcoming terrain changes. Additionally, if there's a pedestrian crossing the road ahead, your vehicle will receive a V2P alert, allowing it to stop in time.

## Cyberattacks on CAVs
