## System Hardening and Virtualization Security

- **System Hardening** helps to configure systems to minimize vulnerabilities and resist attacks.
- **Principles**:
  - **Single-Function Servers**: Isolate functions to reduce risks.
  - **Remove Unnecessary Services**: Reduce the attack surface by disabling unused features.
  - **Limit Privileges**: Apply the principle of least privilege to services and accounts.
  - **Change Default Passwords**: Prevent easy exploitation by attackers.
  - **Nonessential Accounts**: Remove or disable unused accounts to reduce risks.
- **Examples**:
  - Disable “guest” accounts.
  - Use service accounts without interactive login permissions.
- **Virtualization Security** is hardening virtualization environments to reduce risks.
- **Key Measures**:
  - Limit physical access and enable monitoring.
  - Use encrypted remote administration like SSH.
  - Regularly patch hypervisors and guest OSs.
  - Back up virtual machines and monitor logs for anomalies.

## Password Management and Forgotten Password Solutions

- Passwords remain a critical layer of defense for access management.
- **Challenges**: Forgotten passwords, account lockouts, and password reuse increase operational burden.
- **Password Controls**:
  - **Length**: Minimum 8 characters; encourage passphrases.
  - **Complexity**: Require a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.
  - **Expiration**: Rotate passwords periodically (e.g., 90 days).
  - **Lockout Thresholds**: Prevent brute-force attacks (4–10 failed attempts).
- **Solution Methods**:
  - **Self-Service**: Reset via secret questions or emailed links.
  - **Assisted Reset**: Service desk verifies identity before issuing a new password.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Avoid sharing or emailing passwords directly.
  - Require immediate password changes after resets.
  - Secure and monitor reset systems to prevent unauthorized use.

## Protecting Mobile Computing

- **Laptop Controls**:
  - Whole-disk encryption, firewalls, advanced anti-malware.
  - Policies on physical security (e.g., cable locks, employee-only access).
- **BYOD Challenges**: Employee-owned devices increase risks.
- **Mobile Device Management (MDM)**:
  - Remote wipe capabilities.
  - Encryption enforcement.
  - Application download restrictions.
