## Introduction to Network Models

- Network models define how data is transferred across networks by standardizing processes, enabling compatibility among devices and applications. Models such as OSI and TCP/IP are fundamental in establishing a shared framework that allows devices from different manufacturers to work together.
- Network models help organize complex processes into layers, making it easier to troubleshoot, design, and upgrade networks. Each layer has specific tasks, such as addressing, error checking, and session control, ensuring a clear division of responsibilities.

**Two Main Models**: The OSI model and the TCP/IP model are two widely accepted frameworks. OSI provides a seven-layer approach, while TCP/IP follows a four-layer structure. These models serve as teaching tools, design standards, and protocols for effective data communication across global networks.

## OSI Model

- The OSI model, created by ISO and ITU, was developed to provide a comprehensive standard for networking functions, facilitating communication across different systems.
- Comprising seven layers, the OSI model organizes functions into logical categories, from physical data transmission to application-level services.
- As data travels down the OSI layers, each layer adds its own header or information, encapsulating data before transmission. This encapsulation ensures that data reaches its destination in a structured format, maintaining integrity and allowing for error detection and correction.

## Physical and Data Link Layer

- **Physical Layer**: Foundational layer of the OSI model, is responsible for the actual physical connection between devices, handling raw data bit. It includes physical elements such as cables, switches, and connectors that enable devices to transmit signals (e.g., electrical, light, or radio waves).
  **Standards and Protocols**: Standards at this layer ensure consistency in data transmission. Examples include Ethernet (10BASE-T, 100BASE-TX), Fiber Optics for light-based data transfer, and DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) for high-speed internet over telephone lines.
  **Data Transmission**: At this level, data is handled as bits—0s and 1s—without interpretation, focusing purely on transmitting binary data across media.
- **Data Link Layer**: This layer oversees data transfer between directly connected nodes, grouping raw bits into frames and ensuring that each frame reaches its destination within the local network.This layer includes error-checking mechanisms such as checksums to identify and possibly correct errors in transmitted data.
  - **Data Frames**: Frames carry MAC addresses, which uniquely identify devices on the local network, making this layer essential for device-to-device communication within the same network.

  - Switches provide faster data transmission, better network performance, and improved security by not broadcasting data indiscriminately.
  - Auditors evaluate switch configurations, focusing on VLAN (Virtual LAN) settings, access control lists, and MAC filtering to secure network communications and control data flow within sensitive segments.
- ATM is a telecommunications protocol used to support high-speed data transmission, notably in the core networks of telecommunication carriers.
  - Communication in ATM occurs over virtual circuits, establishing a path before transmission to guarantee packet delivery.
  - Auditors examine ATM configurations to ensure QoS settings align with business needs and that traffic prioritization does not inadvertently compromise security or performance across sensitive data streams.

## IPsec - Security in IP Networks

- **Introduction**: IPsec, or Internet Protocol Security, secures IP-based communication by adding layers of encryption and authentication, essential for maintaining data integrity and confidentiality.
- **Modes of Operation**:
  - **Transport Mode**: Encrypts only the data payload, leaving the IP header unchanged for routing purposes.
  - **Tunnel Mode**: Encapsulates the entire IP packet, encrypting both the header and payload, making it suitable for secure virtual private networks (VPNs).
- IPsec establishes SAs to create secure channels, defined by authentication methods and encryption keys.
- Auditors examine IPsec configurations, focusing on VPNs, to ensure proper encryption and authentication for sensitive data transmissions, particularly over the internet.

## IPv4 Addressing

- **IP Addressing**: IP addressing provides a unique identifier for each device on a network, ensuring that data reaches the correct destination.
- **IP Structure**:
  - **IPv4**: A 32-bit address format, divided into four octets (e.g., 192.168.1.1). Each octet can range from 0 to 255, providing around 4.3 billion unique addresses.
  - **Subnet Mask**: Used to distinguish network portions from device portions within an IP address, aiding in organizing devices within networks.
- **Subnetting**: Divides large networks into smaller subnetworks, improving traffic management and security.
- Auditors ensure IP addresses and subnet masks are assigned logically and comply with

**Figure 5-22** A subnet mask denotes which part of an IP address signifies a network and which part signifies a station on the network.

## Classful and Classless Networks

- **Classful Networks**: Originally, IPv4 addresses were divided into classes (A, B, C) to allocate IP addresses efficiently.
  - **Class A**: Large networks with over 16 million addresses.
  - **Class B**: Medium-sized networks, up to 65,536 addresses.
  - **Class C**: Small networks, allowing up to 256 addresses.
- **Limitations**: Classful addressing was wasteful, often leading to unused addresses.
- **Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)**: Introduced to allow flexible allocation by using variable-length subnet masks.
  - **CIDR Notation**: Uses a suffix to indicate subnet mask length (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).
- CIDR minimizes IP waste and improves network efficiency. Auditors check for appropriate CIDR usage and IP allocation to align with organizational needs.

## IPv6 Addressing - Overcoming IPv4 Limitations

- IPv6 was developed to address IPv4 limitations, primarily the shortage of available addresses, by expanding the address space to 128 bits.
  - **Address Format**: Written as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
  - **Enhanced Capacity**: Supports 2^128 addresses, sufficient for global network expansion.
- **IPv6 Subnetting**:
  - **Fixed Prefix Length**: Standard /64 subnet size simplifies network planning.
- Many devices now support both IPv4 and IPv6 (dual-stack), enabling gradual transition.
- Auditors assess IPv6 adoption, ensure compatibility, and check for secure configurations to prevent unauthorized access.

## Protocol Data Units (PDUs) in Network Layers

- PDUs are the specific units of data transmitted at each OSI layer, essential for understanding data encapsulation.
  - **Layer-Specific Terms**:
    - Physical Layer: Bits
    - Data Link Layer: Frames
    - Network Layer: Packets
    - Transport Layer: Segments (TCP) or Datagrams (UDP)

## Types of Protocols

- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**: Allows batch transfer of files between systems; lacks encryption.
- **FTPS and SFTP**: Secure versions of FTP using SSL/TLS and SSH, respectively, to protect data integrity and confidentiality.
- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**: Routes email over the internet; lacks native security.
- **POP and IMAP**: Email retrieval protocols; typically unsecured but can use SSL/TLS for encryption.
- **Instant Messaging (IM)**: Real-time messaging over the internet; can be encrypted for security.
- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: Translates domain names to IP addresses, essential for internet navigation. Resolves names like "example.com" to IP addresses, enabling users to access services without memorizing IP addresses.
- **LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)**: Used for managing and accessing directory information, often in enterprise environments. Centralized access to user information and computing resources; integrates with Microsoft Active Directory.

## Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) - Secure Remote Connections

- VPNs create secure, encrypted tunnels over public networks, allowing private data exchange.
  - **Uses**: Remote employee access, secure branch office connections.
  - **Types of VPNs**:
    - **Site-to-Site VPNs**: Connects two networks over the internet, typically used for branch offices.
    - **Remote Access VPNs**: Allows individuals to access a network remotely.
- **Encryption Standards**: Ensure strong encryption methods like IPsec and SSL/TLS are used.
- **Access Controls**: Auditors assess VPN access policies to confirm that only authorized users can connect.
