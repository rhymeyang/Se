- Professional Independence (Guideline 2003)
- Audit Evidence (Guideline 2205)
- Follow-Up Activities (Guideline 2402)
- Audit Reporting (Guideline 2401)

## Relationship Between Standards and Guidelines

- **Standards**
  - ISACA audit standards serve as fundamental rules that all IS auditors must follow.
  - They are regarded as mandatory principles, much like a legal framework for auditors to ensure professional and ethical audit activities.
- **Guidelines**
  - ISACA guidelines complement the standards by offering further explanations and assistance on how the standards can be implemented in real-world audit scenarios.
  - They serve as practical advice for auditors to achieve compliance with standards.

## ISACA Risk IT Framework

- **Overview of the Framework**
  The ISACA Risk IT Framework provides a structured approach to managing IT-related risks within the broader enterprise risk management program. It offers guidance on integrating IT risk into overall business risk considerations.
- **Key Components**
  The framework consists of three primary components:
  1. Risk governance,
  2. Risk evaluation,
  3. Risk response.
- Together, these elements help organizations identify, assess, and address IT risks in a structured and business-focused manner.

## Risk Governance, Evaluation and Response

- **Risk Governance**
  Risk governance ensures that IT risk management is aligned with the organization’s overall risk management efforts.
  It integrates IT risks into enterprise risk management, ensuring that decision-makers are aware of the potential IT risks and their impact on business objectives.
- **Risk Evaluation**
  Risk evaluation involves assessing the potential impact of risks on business processes and assets.
  This process helps organizations determine which risks need to be addressed and prioritize them accordingly.
- **Risk Response**
  The Risk IT Framework also provides a structured process for responding to identified risks.
  This includes **risk treatment** through **mitigation strategies**, such as implementing controls or transferring risk through insurance.

## Risk Mitigation and Countermeasures

- Once risks are identified, auditors must recommend or evaluate the implementation of mitigating controls.
- These countermeasures reduce the probability or impact of risks, helping organizations protect their assets and operations.
- During audits, IS auditors may apply additional scrutiny to high-risk areas by increasing sampling rates, conducting more interviews, or performing additional tests to ensure controls are effective.
- After implementing countermeasures, auditors should reassess controls to ensure they are effective.
- This involves continuous monitoring of the control environment and re-testing where necessary to confirm improvements.
- Some controls may include self-monitoring mechanisms. Auditors should review the records of these self-monitoring systems to assess their impact on risk mitigation.

## Types of Controls in Risk Management

- Physical, Technical, and Administrative Controls
  Controls are classified into three types:
  - Physical (e.G., Locks, cameras),
  - Technical (e.G., Encryption, firewalls), and
  - Administrative (e.G., Policies, procedures).

These controls work together to reduce risks and ensure business objectives are met.

## Classes of Controls in Risk Management

- **Preventive, Detective, and Deterrent Controls**
  Controls can be classified by function:
  - Preventive controls stop unwanted events,
  - Detective controls record events,
  - Deterrent controls discourage undesirable actions.

Auditors must evaluate these classes to ensure that risks are effectively managed.

- **Corrective, Compensating, and Recovery Controls**
  - Corrective controls address problems after they occur
  - Compensating controls fill in gaps where direct controls cannot be implemented,
  - Recovery controls restore systems to normal operations after an incident.
