tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#introduction"><span>INTRODUCTION</span></a></h2><ul><li>Transportation systems are increasingly linked to other systems and to the physical world in which the system is deployed.</li><li>These systems use sensors to understand the properties of objects and systems with which they interact.</li><li>Recently, the term ‘cyber-physical’ has emerged to describe systems that are a blend of physical sensing and computation and that are networked with other similar systems.</li><li>The collection of these systems is widely <strong>touted</strong> as the ‘Internet of Things (IoT)’.</li><li>The National Science Foundation of the United States uses the following definition: cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are engineered systems that are built from, and depend upon, the seamless integration of computational algorithms and physical components.</li><li>The seamless integration is accomplished through carefully structured and rigorously analyzed system architecture.</li><li>The integration makes certain system design problems explicit earlier than in traditional system development.</li></ul><h2 id="background" tabindex="-1"><a

href="#architecture-analysis-and-design-language"><span>Architecture Analysis and Design Language</span></a></h3><ul><li>Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL) is strongly typed and can be extended through the use of <strong>annex languages</strong>.</li><li>Some examples are an error model annex, which specifies propagation errors, a behavior annex, which allows us to add behavior to the architecture using the concept of state machines, and others such as security and safety.</li><li>AADL models both software and hardware. <ul><li>Software is represented by process, thread, and subprogram constructs, while hardware components are represented by device, processor, bus, and memory constructs.</li><li>The language has an integration component typed as ‘system’ that ties software and hardware together.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="quality-attributes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#quality-attributes"><span>Quality Attributes</span></a></h3><ul><li>Transportation systems are partially defined by functional requirements—what the system must do—and by nonfunctional requirements—attributes of the system.</li><li>These attributes describe the qualities of the system, such as reliability, availability, and many others.</li><li>The ISO 9126 standard, which has been replaced by ISO/IEC 25010, provides a categorization of these attributes.</li><li>The quality attributes support trade studies in which the different attribute values resulting from different design decisions are compared, allowing the architect to choose the design action that will be best, given the objectives of the architecture.</li></ul><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="Quality attributes"></p><h3 id="frameworks"

href="#mobility"><span>Mobility</span></a></h3><ul><li>Transportation systems involve the movement of people from one place to another, and their smart devices must be sufficiently mobile to move with them while continuing to deliver service.</li><li>The transportation engineer needs to understand the environment in which the transportation system will be deployed in order to make appropriate design decisions.</li><li>There are transportation systems that are stationary, but many newly emerging capabilities are based on being mobile so that the user can use the capability from exactly where they are, rather than going to a spot possibly removed from the events that require attention.</li></ul><h3 id="agility-of-development" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#agility-of-development"><span>Agility of Development</span></a></h3><ul><li>Technologies for intelligent transportation systems are rapidly evolving, but transportation systems are large, and development projects associated with these systems are also large and often slow-moving.</li><li>In order to take advantage of emerging technologies, architectures must be modified to allow for faster modification and deployment.</li><li>DevOps is an emerging organizational technique that merges development and operations responsibilities to facilitate the development-to-deployment cycle.</li><li>The basic idea is to ensure that requirements related to deployment are treated as equally important as other capabilities.</li></ul><h2 id="emerging-architectures" tabindex="-1"><a
