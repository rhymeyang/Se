Coordination between cybersecurity engineering and expertise from other disciplines can support the in-depth analysis and mitigation of specific cybersecurity risks (cf. ISO/TR 4804 [6]). Cybersecurity monitoring, remediation and incident response activities complement concept and product development activities as a reactive approach acknowledging the changing conditions in the environment (e.g. new attack technologies) and the ongoing need to identify and manage weaknesses and vulnerabilities in road vehicle E/E systems.</p><p>A defence-in-depth approach can be used to mitigate cybersecurity risk. The defence-in-depth approach utilizes layers of cybersecurity controls to improve the cybersecurity of the vehicle.

This document defines requirements in a generic manner such that it can be applied to a variety of items and components. In addition, tailoring can be applied (see 6.4.3) that is based on a rationale and is defined in the cybersecurity plan. Examples of when tailoring can be used include:</p><ul><li>reuse (see 6.4.4),</li><li>component out-of-context (see 6.4.5),</li><li>use of an off-the-shelf component (see 6.4.6),</li><li>update (see 13.4).</li></ul><p>Reuse of items and components is a possible development strategy that can be applied, with or without modifications to an item, component, or their operational environment. However, modifications can introduce vulnerabilities that might not have been considered for the original item or component. Furthermore, there might have been a change in known attacks, for example:</p><ul><li>an evolution of attack techniques,</li><li>newly emerged vulnerabilities, e.g. learned from cybersecurity monitoring (see 8.3) and/or cybersecurity event evaluation (see 8.4), or</li><li>a change of the assets since the original development.</li></ul><p>If the original item or component was developed in accordance with this document, the reuse of that item or component is based on the existing work products. If the item or component was not originally developed in accordance with this document, the reuse can be based on the existing documentation with a rationale.</p><p>A component can be developed out-of-context, i.e. based on an assumed context. An organization can develop generic components for different applications and for different customers, prior to engagement or commercial agreement with a customer. The supplier can make assumptions about the context and intended use. Based on this, the supplier can derive requirements for the out-of-context development. For example, a microcontroller can be developed out-of-context.</p><p>An off-the-shelf component is a component that is not developed on behalf of a specific customer and that can be used without modification of its design or implementation, e.g. a third-party software library, an open source software component. An off-the-shelf component is not assumed to have been developed in accordance with this document.</p><p>Figure 5 shows that both an off-the-shelf component and an out-of-context component can be integrated into an item or component in accordance with this document. The integration can involve activities similar to reuse analysis in 6.4.4, and if changes are made to address invalid assumptions then change management (see 5.4.4) applies. The changes can be made to a component that is intended to be integrated and/or to the component or item that is the target of the integration.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="image-20241027002030660"></p><p><strong>Figure 5</strong> — Integration of off-the-shelf and out-of-context components</p><p>The cybersecurity case (see 6.4.7) is an input to a cybersecurity assessment and to the release for post- development.</p><p>The cybersecurity assessment (see 6.4.8) judges independently the cybersecurity of an item or component and is an input for the decision to the release for post-development (see 6.4.9).</p><h3 id="_6-2-objectives" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-2-objectives"><span>6.2 Objectives</span></a></h3><p>The objectives of this clause are to:</p><ul><li>a) assign the responsibilities regarding the project’s cybersecurity activities;</li><li>b) plan the cybersecurity activities, including the definition of the tailored cybersecurity activities;
