DATABASE SYSTEMS FOR CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS</span></a></h2><p>Table 7.2 Common Database Security Threats</p><table><thead><tr><th>Database Threat</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Excessive and unused privileges</td><td>When users are granted database privileges that exceed the requirements of their job function, privileges can be used to gain access to confidential information. Also, when employee job roles change, corresponding changes to access rights to sensitive data are often not updated. Per Imperva [20], 47% of companies report that their users have excessive rights. A query-level access control is used to restrict privileges to minimum required operations and data.</td></tr><tr><td>Privilege abuse</td><td>Users may abuse legitimate database privileges for unauthorised purposes. Database systems administrators (DBAs) have unlimited access to all data in the database. A DBA may choose to access unauthorised, sensitive application data directly without going through the application‚Äôs authorisation and access controls. Privilege abuse is an insider threat. In 2016, more than 65% of the data breach losses were attributed to privileges abuse [20]. Enforce policies restrict not only what data are accessible but also how the data are accessed.</td></tr><tr><td>SQL injection and insufficient application security</td><td>Hackers insert unauthorised or malicious SQL statements to get access to the data to copy or alter it. A query- level access control is effective in detecting unauthorised queries injected via web applications and database stored procedures.</td></tr><tr><td>Weak audit trail</td><td>Failure to collect detailed audit records of database activity represents a serious organisational risk on many levels. Fine-granular audit, unfortunately, degrades database performance. Native audit tools of the database vendors are typically inadequate to record the contextual details required to detect attacks and support security and compliance auditing. Network- based audit appliances operate independently of all users and offer granular data collection without performance penalty. Imperva notes that only 19% of companies perform database monitoring [20].</td></tr><tr><td>Unsecured storage media</td><td>Unprotected backup storage media is often stolen. High- privilege users such as DBAs will often have direct physical access to the database servers. Such users can turnoff native audit mechanism and copy data by issuing SQL commands. To prevent this type of data breach, all database backup files should be encrypted.</td></tr><tr><td>Malware and platform vulnerabilities</td><td>Advanced attacks that blend multiple tactics such as spear phishing emails and malware are used to penetrate organisations and steal-sensitive data. Intrusion detection software and intrusion prevention software (IPS) are effective in detecting and blocking known database platform vulnerabilities and malware.</td></tr><tr><td>Platform vulnerabilities</td><td>Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in database management systems and the underlying operating systems. For example, attackers exploit vulnerabilities such as default accounts and passwords and database system configuration parameters to launch attacks.</td></tr><tr><td>Denial of service (DoS)</td><td>The attack renders the system unavailable to the authenticated and authorised users. Buffer overflows, data corruption, network flooding and resource consumption are typical DoS techniques. Resource consumption is unique to databases and is often overlooked. An attacker may rapidly open a large number of database connections. This in turn triggers the connection rate control, which will prevent legitimate users from consuming database server resources. DoS prevention measure should target multiple layers including the network, applications and databases. IPS and connection rate controls are effective in combating DoS.</td></tr><tr><td>Limited security expertise and education</td><td>Many smaller organisations lack the expertise required to implement data and application security controls and policies. This coupled with lack of user training opens doors to security breaches. Invest in security software and user training.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="_4-1-cluster-based-distributed-computing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-1-cluster-based-distributed-computing"><span>4.1 CLUSTER- BASED DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING</span></a></h3><ul><li>Distributed computing is a paradigm in which networked computers solve computational problems through communication and coordination by passing messages.</li><li>Concurrent execution, absence of a global clock and independent failure of components characterise distributed systems.</li><li>In the context of NoSQL systems, distributed computing is a means to provide performance at scale and achieve high availability and reliability.</li><li>NoSQL architectures consist of several components (e.g., storage disks, CPUs, application servers) residing on networked computers.</li><li>The components communicateand coordinate their actions to achieve a common goal through mechanisms such as shared memory and message passing.</li><li>Client-server architecture is a widely used computing model for distributed applications.</li><li>A server provides a service which is made available to the clients through an API or protocol.</li><li>Typically, the server and clients reside on physically different computers and communicate over a network.

DATA ANALYTICS FOR CYBER- PHYSICAL SYSTEMS</span></a></h2><p>Data analytics (DA) is the science of drawing inferences, making predictions and gaining insights into heterogeneous data which is drawn and integrated from multiple data sources.</p><p>DA has its genesis in early versions of computer spreadsheets and RDBMS as online analytical processing.</p><p>Its evolution and advances were referred to by various names including data mining, business intelligence, visual analytics and cognitive analytics.</p><p>This evolution was primarily driven by ML, high-performance computing and big data.</p><p>DA has now become a pervasive term-image analytics, video analytics, text analytics and road traffic analytics- and now refers to the processes of extracting information from unstructured data and using this information for quantitative decision-making.</p><h3 id="_5-1-types-of-data-analytics" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-1-types-of-data-analytics"><span>5.1 TYPES OF DATA ANALYTICS</span></a></h3><ul><li>Based on its intended purpose, DA is categorised into four classes - descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive.</li><li>The classes are highly interrelated and their functional overlap is significant. These classes should be viewed as facets spanning a workflow rather than as four distinct categories.</li><li>Regardless of the domain, DA is comprised of three activities: data acquisition, cleaning, transforming and loading; methods and algorithms and a computational platform that implicitly embodies workflows and best practices.</li><li>The first activity involves preparing the input data and loading it into the computational platform.</li><li>Various statistical and ML algorithms and approaches for data analysis are used to accomplish the second task.</li><li>Lastly, the computational platform integrates the first two activities and provides interfaces for users and other applications.</li></ul><h3 id="_5-2-descriptive-analytics" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-2-descriptive-analytics"><span>5.2 DESCRIPTIVE ANALYTICS</span></a></h3><ul><li>The goal of descriptive analytics is providing insights into the past leading to the present.</li><li>It helps to learn from the past and use this knowledge to improve operational efficiencies and spot activities that consume disproportionate amounts of resources (aka resource drains).</li><li>Descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis (EDA) are the primary tools used for implementing descriptive analytics.</li><li>Descriptive statistics provides tools to quantitatively describe the data in summary and graphical forms-measures of central tendency (mean, median and mode) and dispersion (minimum and maximum values, range, quantiles, standard deviation/variance, distribution skewness and kurtosis).</li><li>EDA brings a visual dimension to descriptive analytics in the form of histograms, scatter plots, matrix plots, box-and-whisker plots, steamand- leaf diagrams, rootograms, resistant time series smoothing and bubble charts.</li><li>This visual exploration helps to gain an intuitive understanding of the data and provides scaffolding for guided inquiry. It also helps to identify research questions for further investigation.</li></ul><h3 id="_5-3-diagnostic-analytics" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-3-diagnostic-analytics"><span>5.3 DIAGNOSTIC ANALYTICS</span></a></h3><p>Diagnostic analytics helps to identify factors that are responsible for what has been observed through descriptive analytics.</p><p>In other words, it addresses the question ‚Äòwhy did it happen?‚Äô</p><p>Several techniques including data mining and data warehousing are used to answer the question.</p><p>It is exploratory in nature and requires a human-in- theloop.</p><p>Diagnostic analytics has been used in the education and learning domain for long under the name diagnostic assessment, which is a manual process.</p><h3 id="_5-4-predictive-analytics" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-4-predictive-analytics"><span>5.4 PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS</span></a></h3><p>Predictive analytics is about predicting the future based on the past.</p><p>It answers the ‚Äòwhat if‚Äô questions by building predictive models using inferential statistics and forecasting techniques.</p><p>Predictive analytics helps to implement preventive actions or change course.</p><p>Predictive models are probabilistic in nature and require substantial data for building the models.</p><p>Selecting which variables to use for building prediction models is referred to as variable/feature selection.</p><p>EDA often reveals which variables are good candidates for model building.</p><p>Classification algorithms such as naive Bayes, multilayer perceptron, neural networks, radial basis functions, support vector machines and k-nearest neighbours are also used in predictive analytics.</p><h3 id="_5-5-prescriptive-analytics" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-5-prescriptive-analytics"><span>5.5 PRESCRIPTIVE ANALYTICS</span></a></h3><p>Prescriptive analytics is closely associated with diagnostic and predictive analytics.</p><p>While diagnostic analytics answers the question ‚Äòwhy did it happen?‚Äô and prescriptive analytics helps to answer the question ‚Äòwhat is likely to happen‚Äô, prescriptive analytics is used to increase the chance of realising the desired events or diminishing the chances of occurrence of undesired events.</p><p>Prescriptive analytics is evolving into what is referred to as cognitive analytics.</p><p>Cognitive computing and cognitive science are the foundation of cognitive analytics.</p><p>One aspect of cognitive analytics is to compute multiple answers to questions and associate a degree of confidence with each answer.</p><p>Because of the inherent complexity and nascency of cognitive analytics, very few organisations have implemented it.</p><h3 id="_5-6-data-analytics-resources-and-tools" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-6-data-analytics-resources-and-tools"><span>5.6 DATA ANALYTICS RESOURCES AND TOOLS</span></a></h3><p>DA systems come in various forms with functional capabilities that vary widely.</p><p>Commercial vendors include SAS, Microsoft, Oracle, Teradata and Tableau Software.</p><p>Python, Java and R are very popular programming languages for implementing DA.</p><p>ML frameworks and libraries such as TensorFlow, Weka3 and Keras provide suitable abstraction to expedite DA applications.</p><p>The Apache UIMA project provides open-source frameworks, tools and annotators for information extraction from unstructured data.</p><p>Apache Hadoop and Spark are widely used open-source computing platforms for big data processing and cognitive analytics.</p><h2 id="_6-current-trends-and-research-issues" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-current-trends-and-research-issues"><span>6. CURRENT TRENDS AND RESEARCH ISSUES</span></a></h2><p>CPS applications and their complexity are growing at an exponential rate.</p><p>The behaviour of hardware and software in the cyberspace and the physical systems in the physical environment are well understood in isolation.</p><p>However, the emergent properties that arise when cyber systems interact with the physical world are complex and do not lend themselves for modelling and analysis.</p><p>Ad hoc approaches to CPS system design and implementation may result in systems that are brittle, are not scalable and lack design flexibility.</p><p>Formal approaches to CPS design with provision for automated verification and validation is required to minimise software bugs and hardware malfunction and thwart cybersecurity attacks.</p><p>CPS-based ITS, in general, and vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to- infrastructure communication, in particular, will have significant impact on people in all walks of life.</p><p>CPS will have even more impact on automotive services such as testing, development, maintenance and repair.</p><p>Given the data quality and cybersecurity issues, CPS decision-making for missioncritical applications must necessarily involve human-in-the- loop.</p><p>/images/306/w0701.png</p>',163)]))}const m=a(d,[["render",h],["__file","Week07.html.vue"]]),g=JSON.parse('{"path":"/306/Week07.html","title":"Chapter 7: Data Management Issues in Cyber-Physical Systems","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"SMART DATA ANALYTICS: BMW GROUP RELIES ON INTELLIGENT USE OF PRODUCTION DATA.","slug":"smart-data-analytics-bmw-group-relies-on-intelligent-use-of-production-data","link":"#smart-data-analytics-bmw-group-relies-on-intelligent-use-of-production-data","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"OBJECTIVES","slug":"objectives","link":"#objectives","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"1.
