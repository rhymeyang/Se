electric vehicles.</li><li>Moreover, every one of those 15 lamp posts is equipped with an emergency button, providing immediate access to the city’s public services, including police and firefighters.</li></ul><h3 id="_4-4-smart-parking-services" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-4-smart-parking-services"><span>4.4 Smart parking services</span></a></h3><ul><li>Vehicles looking for a parking spot in a downtown business district account for a significant portion of congestion.</li><li>According to Shoup, the amount of vehicles that are cruising for parking account for almost 40% of total traffic volume.</li><li>This additional traffic causes traffic congestion, wasted time and wasted energy in the form of fuel.</li><li>For example, in Los Angles, California, searching for parking spots creates around 730 tons of CO2, 95,000 lost work hours and wastes 47,000 gallons of gasoline annually.</li><li>Providing motorists timely information about available parking spaces could reduce congestion.</li><li>There are various smart parking concepts that are deployed in many cities around the world.</li><li>An overview of several of the prominent concepts is presented in following subsections.</li></ul><h4 id="_4-4-1-copark-approach" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-4-1-copark-approach"><span>4.4.1 CoPark approach</span></a></h4><ul><li>This smart parking system uses V2V and V2I communication to locate any unoccupied parking spaces within the shortest possible travel time.</li><li>This decentralised system uses wireless communication among smart agents (e.g., smart Wi-Fi sensors) installed in a vehicle to inform others about any unoccupied parking space.</li><li>In this system, a roadside unit installed at the parking entrance informs and guides approaching vehicles to the nearest vacant parking spaces.</li><li>Fig. 11.11 illustrates a sensor-based parking system that uses wireless communications to detect the presence of vehicles and send the information to a server.</li><li>Other vehicles can communicate with the server to identify available/empty parking spaces and their locations.</li></ul><p><img src="'+p+'" alt="Picture1"> Figure 11.11 Smart parking system using sensors.</p><h4 id="_4-4-2-park-and-ride-approach" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-4-2-park-and-ride-approach"><span>4.4.2 Park and ride approach</span></a></h4><ul><li>In the suburbs of San Francisco, California, Rockridge Bay Area Rapid Transit is the first smart park and ride system in the United States.</li><li>In this smart parking system, anyone can park at strategically placed parking facilities and ride on a fixed route commuter bus or a train to reach their destinations.</li><li>It typically provides real-time traffic information to users through message signs about vacancy of parking spaces in each lot, departure of the next bus or train and downstream traffic condition.</li><li>Based on the real-time parking and traffic congestion information, one can easily decide whether to use park and ride or drive their own vehicle.</li></ul><h4 id="_4-4-3-crowdsourcing-based-approach" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-4-3-crowdsourcing-based-approach"><span>4.4.3 Crowdsourcing-based approach</span></a></h4><ul><li>Crowd Park is a social networking application that allows individual drivers to book a parking space and prepay the parking fee.</li><li>Using the sensors of a smartphone, it is possible to detect a driver’s transportation mode, such as whether they are driving or walking.</li><li>If a transition pattern is identified, such as driving/stopped/walking, the system could conclude that the vehicle is parked.</li><li>The application can also detect whether the traveller is walking towards the parking lot and inform others of a prediction that a parking spot could be available soon.</li><li>Moreover, driverscan upload information at their own will to let other drivers know when their parking spot is going to be available again.</li></ul><h3 id="_4-5-smart-intersections" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-5-smart-intersections"><span>4.5 Smart intersections</span></a></h3><ul><li>The smart intersection concept is enabled by real-time communication between motor vehicles, public transport, traffic signals, emergency vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians for safe and efficient operation of multimodal conflicts at intersections.</li><li>As future CAV will communicate with each other with V2V and with traffic signal systems through V2I, legacy traffic control systems at intersections need to be modernised.</li><li>Important features of smart intersections include smart optimisation of signal phase and timing (SPaT) applications, information sharing with approaching vehicles about safe speed, eco-friendly signal operations, intersection safety warning and collision avoidance.</li><li>Though CAV technologies are mostly under development, many large cities have been demonstrating the idea of smart intersections to improve mobility performance.</li><li>Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, US, is one of the first cities implementing this smart intersection idea.</li><li>A pilot project of 18 intersections at East Liberty and Shadyside, the smart traffic control system concept was implemented through the use of a intersection camera and radar detection system.</li></ul><hr><p><img src="'+g+'" alt="Picture1"></p><p>Figure 11.12
