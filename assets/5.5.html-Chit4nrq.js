In the United States, the Department of Homeland Security has a color-coded advisory system that categorizes the danger of potential threats to citizens. This system gives security professionals direction by telling them how quickly to act and which efforts to make to keep the country safe. There&#39;s a similar scoring system in place for IT security threats to organizations and businesses. It&#39;s called the Common Vulnerability Scoring System, or CVSS. Instead of colors, this system uses numbers to rank IT vulnerabilities.</p><p>CVSS Calculator 00:37-01:01 A CVSS calculator can determine a vulnerability&#39;s severity level based on three metrics: base, temporal, and environmental metrics. Base metrics describe a vulnerability&#39;s unique characteristics. Temporal metrics describe its changeable attributes, and environmental metrics describe vulnerabilities that are only present in certain environments or implementations.</p><p>Government Resources 01:01-01:23 This scoring system creates a way for you to prioritize vulnerabilities that you might discover on your network. It also gives you credibility when you present your remediation plan of action, as these are internationally recognized scores. Through the Department of Homeland Security, the US government sponsors five valuable resources for security analysts. Let&#39;s go through them one by one.</p><p>Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures 01:23-01:55 The first one is Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, or CVE. This is a list of standardized identifiers for known software vulnerabilities and exposures. CVE is free to use and publicly available at cve.mitre.org. There are currently 94 CVE numbering authorities from 16 countries, which provides a good evaluation baseline for you. It also provides standardization, which allows data exchange for cybersecurity automation and aids professionals as they determine the best assessment tools to use.</p><p>National Vulnerability Database 01:55-02:36 The CVE list also supplies the National Vulnerability Database. The National Vulnerability Database, or NVD, was originally created in 2000. You can find it at nvd.nist.gov. The NVD list includes more specific information for each entry than the CVE list, such as fix information, severity scores, and impact ratings. This list is searchable by product name or version number, vendor, operating system, impact, severity, and related exploit range. This detailed database adds breadth to your research. The variety of ways to find results on the site makes searches very efficient.</p><p>Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency 02:36-03:10 The third resource is the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA. You can access it at us-cert.gov. This government site provides information exchange, training and exercises, risk and vulnerability assessments, data synthesis and analysis, operational planning and coordination, watch operations, and incident response and recovery resources. This site is valuable because it belongs to a large governmental organization with many resources committed to helping you with cybersecurity.</p><p>Common Weakness Enumeration 03:10-03:47 The fourth resource is Common Weakness Enumeration, or CWE. You can find it at cwe.mitre.org. CWE is a community-developed list of common software security weaknesses. The community strives to create commonality in software security weakness descriptions. This creates a reference for identifying, mitigating, and preventing vulnerabilities. It also provides a standardized way to evaluate assessment tools. This site combines diverse ideas and perspectives from professionals, academics, and government sources to create a unified cybersecurity standard.</p><p>Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification 03:47-04:18 The fifth government-sponsored resource is Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification, or CAPEC. You can find it at capec.mitre.org. It&#39;s a dictionary of known cyberattack patterns used by hackers. You can search the list by attack mechanism, attack domain, key terms, and CAPEC ID number. You can browse through the list to see common attacks and their specific patterns. There are other helpful resources available besides the ones sponsored by the Department of Homeland Security. I want to talk about two of them.</p><p>Japanese Vulnerability Notes 04:18-04:43 The first is from a non-profit organization in Japan called JPCERT or JVN, which stands for Japanese Vulnerability Notes. This organization is dedicated to helping cybersecurity professionals protect their organizations from attack. It offers detailed information on vulnerabilities, including affected products, possible impacts, solutions, vendor statements, and reference documents.</p><p>Full Disclosure 04:43-05:11 The final resource is a mailing list from nmap called Full Disclosure. Not only do they provide a mailing list that often has the newest vulnerabilities listed before they show up on the government-sponsored resources, but the site also provides a vendor-neutral forum for discussing exploitation strategies and vulnerabilities. It&#39;s a resource for discovering events that are happening in the cybersecurity community. You can find it at seclists.org/fulldisclosure.</p><p>Summary 05:11-05:55 That&#39;s it for this lesson. In this lesson, we discussed that a vulnerability scoring system exists to help you evaluate and prioritize the severity level of the vulnerabilities you find. It&#39;s critical for security professionals to stay up to date on the most current attack methods. Fortunately, you have several valuable resources that are free for you to access. We introduced you to seven. The first five are sponsored by the United States government. They are CISA, NVD, CVE, CWE, and CAPEC. We also highlighted the Japanese JPCERT or JVN. We finished up by looking at the Full Disclosure vulnerabilities mailing list.</p><h3 id="_5-5-2-vulnerability-scoring-system-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-5-2-vulnerability-scoring-system-facts"><span>5.5.2 Vulnerability Scoring System Facts</span></a></h3><p>This lesson focuses on vulnerability scoring systems.

CVSS, or the Common Vulnerability Scoring System, is a framework used to score and rank the severity of IT vulnerabilities, helping organizations better understand and prioritize the threats they face. The scoring system uses a set of metrics that measure a vulnerability&#39;s technical, environmental, and temporal characteristics. Knowing how to calculate a CVSS score can be helpful.</p><p>The CVSS scoring system consists of several metrics used to calculate a given vulnerability&#39;s risk level and grouped into three categories—Impact, Exploitability, and Remediation.</p><h5 id="categories" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#categories"><span>Categories:</span></a></h5><ul><li>Impact - The potential damage or harm caused by the vulnerability.</li><li>Exploitability - The ease and likelihood of exploiting a vulnerability.</li><li>Remediation - The cost and effort required to fix the vulnerability.</li></ul><h5 id="metrics" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#metrics"><span>Metrics:</span></a></h5><ul><li>Scope - The number of systems and people affected by the vulnerability.</li><li>Confidentiality - The extent to which data is disclosed.</li><li>Integrity - The extent to which the system&#39;s functionality is changed or impaired.</li><li>Availability - The extent to which a system is unavailable.</li><li>Privacy - The extent to which the system&#39;s privacy is impacted.</li><li>Operations - The extent to which the system&#39;s security is affected.</li><li>Other - Any other relevant or important factors.</li></ul><p><img src="'+o+'" alt="The 3 metric groups along with their components."></p><blockquote><p>Description</p><p>Base metric group - exploitability metrics: attack vector, attack complexity, privileges required, and user interaction; impact metrics: confidentiality impact, integrity impact, and availability impact; scope.
