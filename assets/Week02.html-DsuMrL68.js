vehicle technology largely, depends on VANET for transmitting basic safety message, non-safety messages like multimedia messages along with infotainment messages.</li><li>Recently, connected vehicles have gained a lot of attention from industry and academia that could potentially help the safe driving, and traffic situation such as congestion, accident, and road construction.</li><li>The advancement of connectivity in vehicles includes different types of communication technologies for autonomous vehicles.</li><li>The communication between the vehicles and its surroundings such as neighbor vehicles, pedestrian, RSU is based on inter-vehicle communication.</li></ul><h2 id="inter-vehicle-communication" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor"

infrastructure and the cloud using wireless communication.</li><li>The inter-vehicle communication depends on VANET technology.</li><li>VANET uses diverse kinds of communication protocols based on the type of communication and type of infrastructure.</li><li>In VANET, the Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE) protocol provides the basic radio standard for dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) operating in the 5.9 GHz frequency band, which is based on the IEEE 802.11p standard.</li><li>In addition to this, emerging cellular technologies such as LTE and 5G technology can be used for V2X communication in VANET.</li><li>Vehicular communications can be achieved in the infrastructure domain for vehicle-to- infrastructure (V2I) communications to connect to roadside units (RSUs) or in the ad hoc domain for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications or vehicle-to everything (V2X) communications.</li></ul><h2 id="battle-for-adoption" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor"

provide safety and efficacy of the vehicles on the road.</li><li>In the USA, the federal government proposed a mandate to implement V2V in new vehicles based on DSRC.</li><li>Two groups of global automakers and research institutes work toward using wireless communication in autonomous vehicles.</li><li>One group is attracted toward using DSRC technology in autonomous vehicles while the other groups support the use of C-V2X technology due to its potential and evolution toward 5G.</li><li>They switched their focus to C-V2X platform and involved in chip making, testing, and demonstration.</li><li>Since cellular technology is not mature in vehicular communication field compared to DSRC, it might take some time to be widely deployed, as it has not been extensively tested.</li><li>It is operated in licensed band without dedicated and specific MHz band.</li><li>The 5GAA and other research institutes like Qualcomm and Huawei back up this technology and advocate for C-V2X adoption because of its advantages in vehicular communication.</li></ul><h2 id="market-demand-of-automotive-cyber-security" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor"
