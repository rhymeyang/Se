Risk assessment is a structured process by which risks are identified and evaluated. In the context of Business Continuity Planning (BCP), it enables an organization to understand the potential threats to its most critical resources and processes. By anticipating the potential impacts that risks can have, an organization can manage and mitigate the risks. As a disaster recovery professional you should know how to perform risk analysis using various tools like PILAR Basic.</p><h2 id="scenario" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scenario"><span>Scenario</span></a></h2><p>In any organization, it is very important to perform a Qualitative Risk Assessment to identify and analyze the possible risk event and its impact if and when it occurs. Qualitative Risk Assessment works on relative or descriptive measures to analyze the probability of the risk occurring. In a qualitative analysis, likelihood or probability is measured using a relative scale using terms such as low, moderate, high. Risk assessment gives an insight towards security and integrity of different aspects of IT infrastructure of an organization.</p><h2 id="qualitative-risk-assessment-using-pilar-risk-management-tool" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#qualitative-risk-assessment-using-pilar-risk-management-tool"><span>Qualitative Risk Assessment using PILAR Risk Management Tool</span></a></h2><h3 id="scenario-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scenario-1"><span>Scenario</span></a></h3><p>Qualitative risk assessment is the process of using non-numerical based methods to identify and analyze the risk event and its impact if and when it occurs.

In a qualitative analysis, there is a definitive number that gives the probability of the risk occurring. The advantages of quantitative risk assessment are that it provides relatively accurate and replicable results.
