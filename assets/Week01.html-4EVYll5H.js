These vehicles utilize a combination of sensors, artificial intelligence, and communication technologies to interact with their environment, other vehicles, infrastructure, and more. The main goal of CAVs is to enhance safety, improve traffic efficiency, reduce emissions, and offer a better user experience by <strong>automating driving tasks</strong> and <strong>optimizing routes</strong>.</li></ul><h2 id="understanding-v2i-v2v-and-v2x" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#understanding-v2i-v2v-and-v2x"><span>Understanding V2I, V2V and V2X</span></a></h2><ul><li><strong>V2I</strong> communication refers to the exchange of information between a <strong>vehicle</strong> and <strong>road infrastructure</strong>, such as traffic lights, road signs, and traffic management systems. This interaction helps improve traffic flow, enhance safety, and optimize the use of transportation networks.</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Example</strong>: Imagine you&#39;re driving a connected car approaching an intersection. The traffic light ahead is equipped with V2I technology. As you approach, your vehicle communicates with the traffic light system to determine whether it will turn red or green. The system can also adjust the timing of the lights to optimize traffic flow, reducing the likelihood of you having to stop. If the light is about to change, your vehicle receives a notification, allowing you to slow down gradually rather than <strong>braking abruptly</strong>.</p></blockquote><hr><ul><li><strong>V2V</strong> communication allows vehicles to exchange information with each other directly. This information can include data about speed, position, direction, and other driving-related information. V2V communication is crucial for enhancing safety and preventing accidents.</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Example</strong>: You&#39;re driving on the highway when the car in front of you suddenly brakes due to an obstacle on the road. Thanks to V2V communication, your car instantly receives this information from the vehicle ahead and automatically starts braking even before you have time to react. This rapid exchange of data helps prevent <strong>rear-end collisions</strong> and other accidents.</p></blockquote><hr><ul><li>V2X communication is a broader term that <strong>encompasses</strong> both V2I and V2V, as well as communication with other entities like pedestrians (V2P), cyclists, and even the cloud. V2X is about creating a fully connected transportation ecosystem where vehicles interact with everything around them.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Example: You&#39;re driving through a smart city where your vehicle communicates with not just other cars and traffic lights but also with the city&#39;s central traffic management system. The system gathers data from various sources, including weather forecasts and traffic conditions, to optimize your route in real-time. It may suggest alternate routes to avoid <strong>congestion</strong> or automatically adjust your speed to optimize fuel efficiency based on upcoming <strong>terrain changes</strong>. Additionally, if there&#39;s a pedestrian crossing the road ahead, your vehicle will receive a V2P alert, allowing it to stop in time.</p></blockquote><h2 id="cyberattacks-on-cavs" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cyberattacks-on-cavs"><span>Cyberattacks on CAVs</span></a></h2><ul><li><strong>Automotive sector</strong> is increasingly targeted, with cyber incidents affecting a wide range of connected devices, including vehicles.
