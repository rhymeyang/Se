While Agile emphasizes flexibility and iterative development, EVM can be adapted to Agile projects to monitor cost and schedule performance. Agile frameworks often track progress through story points, sprints, or completed iterations, and these can be used as input for calculating EVM metrics like <strong>Earned Value (EV)</strong> and <strong>Cost Performance Index (CPI)</strong>. Thus, EVM and Agile are not mutually exclusive and can be complementary when applied appropriately.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Risk response strategies, such as avoidance and mitigation, should only be applied to high-priority risks. <ul><li>True</li><li>False</li><li>Explain: <ul><li>False</li><li>Risk response strategies, such as <strong>avoidance</strong> and <strong>mitigation</strong>, should not be applied only to high-priority risks. While high-priority risks often require immediate attention, all identified risks should be evaluated, and appropriate strategies should be applied based on their likelihood and impact. Lower-priority risks might also require responses, such as monitoring or contingency planning, to prevent them from escalating.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Matching the terms with their descriptions: <ul><li><strong>Risk Treatment</strong> → C.

It provides a simple visual tool to help stakeholders understand the relative severity of risks and focus on those requiring immediate attention. Quantitative scales can also be incorporated in more detailed analyses, but qualitative scales are commonly used for initial assessments.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>If the Planned Value (PV) is $200,000, Earned Value (EV) is $180,000, and Actual Cost (AC) is $190,000, what is its Schedule Variance (SV) and Cost Variance (CV) and how can it be interpreted? <ul><li>a.
