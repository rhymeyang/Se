These goals guide the design and implementation of security measures in the system development process.</li><li>For example, if a risk of unauthorized access to vehicle control systems is identified, a cybersecurity goal might be to ensure secure access control to critical vehicle functions.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Risk Monitoring and Review</strong>: <ul><li>Risks are not static, so ongoing <strong>monitoring and review</strong> are necessary to ensure that new threats, vulnerabilities, and risks are identified and managed over time.</li><li>This step involves updating the threat analysis and risk assessment as new information becomes available or when the system undergoes changes.</li></ul></li></ol><h3 id="key-concepts-in-tara-as-per-iso-sae-21434" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#key-concepts-in-tara-as-per-iso-sae-21434"><span>Key Concepts in TARA as per ISO/SAE 21434:</span></a></h3><ol><li><p><strong>Cybersecurity Assurance Levels (CALs)</strong>:</p><ul><li>ISO 21434 introduces the concept of <strong>Cybersecurity Assurance Levels (CALs)</strong>, which classify the system based on the level of cybersecurity needed. CALs range from CAL 1 (low) to CAL 4 (very high).</li><li>The level is determined based on the outcome of the TARA, with higher assurance levels requiring more stringent security controls.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA Triad)</strong>:</p><ul><li>The CIA Triad is often used to frame security requirements and threats. In automotive cybersecurity, it refers to: <ul><li><strong>Confidentiality</strong>: Ensuring that sensitive information (e.g., vehicle data, user information) is protected from unauthorized access.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Integrity</strong>: Ensuring that data and system functions are not tampered with or altered by unauthorized parties.</li><li><strong>Availability</strong>: Ensuring that critical vehicle functions and data are available and functional when needed (e.g., braking systems must always be available).</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>STRIDE Threat Modeling</strong>:</p><ul><li>ISO/SAE 21434 often uses the <strong>STRIDE</strong> model to categorize threats. STRIDEstands for: <ul><li><strong>S</strong>poofing (pretending to be someone else),</li><li><strong>T</strong>ampering (modifying data),</li><li><strong>R</strong>epudiation (denying an action),</li><li><strong>I</strong>nformation Disclosure (leaking sensitive data),</li><li><strong>D</strong>enial of Service (disrupting availability),</li><li><strong>E</strong>levation of Privilege (gaining unauthorized control).</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Damage Scenarios</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Damage Scenarios</strong> are used to assess the potential impact of cybersecurity incidents. Each scenario describes what could happen if a specific threat exploits a vulnerability (e.g., a remote hacker taking control of a car’s steering system).</li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>Benefits of TARA in ISO/SAE 21434:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Proactive Risk Mitigation</strong>: By identifying threats and vulnerabilities early in the vehicle’s development process, organizations can mitigate risks before they become critical issues.</li><li><strong>Informed Decision Making</strong>: TARA provides a clear understanding of the risks involved, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions about which risks to accept and which to mitigate.</li><li><strong>Compliance</strong>: Performing TARA ensures compliance with regulatory requirements like <strong>UNECE WP.29</strong>, which mandates cybersecurity risk assessments as part of the Cybersecurity Management System (CSMS).</li></ul>',51)]))}const c=i(r,[["render",a],["__file","01_Notes.html.vue"]]),u=JSON.parse('{"path":"/300/01_Notes.html","title":"Automotive Cybersecurity Standards and Frameworks","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"What is a Cybersecurity Management System?","slug":"what-is-a-cybersecurity-management-system","link":"#what-is-a-cybersecurity-management-system","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Introduction to ISO/SAE 21434: Road Vehicles – Cybersecurity Engineering","slug":"introduction-to-iso-sae-21434-road-vehicles-–-cybersecurity-engineering","link":"#introduction-to-iso-sae-21434-road-vehicles-–-cybersecurity-engineering","children":[{"level":3,"title":"Purpose and Importance","slug":"purpose-and-importance","link":"#purpose-and-importance","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Key Objectives","slug":"key-objectives","link":"#key-objectives","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Scope of ISO/SAE 21434","slug":"scope-of-iso-sae-21434","link":"#scope-of-iso-sae-21434","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Key Components of ISO/SAE 21434","slug":"key-components-of-iso-sae-21434","link":"#key-components-of-iso-sae-21434","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Relation to UNECE WP.29 and CSMS","slug":"relation-to-unece-wp-29-and-csms","link":"#relation-to-unece-wp-29-and-csms","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Benefits of ISO/SAE 21434","slug":"benefits-of-iso-sae-21434","link":"#benefits-of-iso-sae-21434","children":[]}]},{"level":2,"title":"Key Clauses in ISO/SAE 21434","slug":"key-clauses-in-iso-sae-21434","link":"#key-clauses-in-iso-sae-21434","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Summary of Key Activities Across Clauses","slug":"summary-of-key-activities-across-clauses","link":"#summary-of-key-activities-across-clauses","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Key Components of Organizational Cybersecurity Management in ISO/SAE 21434:","slug":"key-components-of-organizational-cybersecurity-management-in-iso-sae-21434","link":"#key-components-of-organizational-cybersecurity-management-in-iso-sae-21434","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Summary of Organizational Cybersecurity Management in ISO/SAE 21434:","slug":"summary-of-organizational-cybersecurity-management-in-iso-sae-21434","link":"#summary-of-organizational-cybersecurity-management-in-iso-sae-21434","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Key Components of Project-Dependent Cybersecurity Management","slug":"key-components-of-project-dependent-cybersecurity-management","link":"#key-components-of-project-dependent-cybersecurity-management","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Summary of Project-Dependent Cybersecurity Management in ISO/SAE 21434:","slug":"summary-of-project-dependent-cybersecurity-management-in-iso-sae-21434","link":"#summary-of-project-dependent-cybersecurity-management-in-iso-sae-21434","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Key Objectives of TARA in ISO/SAE 21434:","slug":"key-objectives-of-tara-in-iso-sae-21434","link":"#key-objectives-of-tara-in-iso-sae-21434","children":[{"level":3,"title":"Steps Involved in TARA as per ISO/SAE 21434:","slug":"steps-involved-in-tara-as-per-iso-sae-21434","link":"#steps-involved-in-tara-as-per-iso-sae-21434","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Key Concepts in TARA as per ISO/SAE 21434:","slug":"key-concepts-in-tara-as-per-iso-sae-21434","link":"#key-concepts-in-tara-as-per-iso-sae-21434","children":[]}]}],"git":{"updatedTime":1729140205000},"filePathRelative":"300/01_Notes.md"}');export{c as comp,u as data};
