widely documented and discussed.</li><li>These were conducted by different researchers and experts that wanted to show how insecure the vehicles really are.</li></ul><ul><li>The final goal of the researchers was maybe not to get famous and hit the headlines of all news portals in the world, but it was definitely the outcome of their research and as such has to be taken into consideration.</li></ul><ul><li>The <strong>OBD port</strong> is shown to have the <strong>highest risk potential</strong>, and even though it requires physical access there are some cases where it <strong>can be exploited remotely</strong>.</li><li>It is also the oldest interface in the CEL library and accessing the OBD port gives the attacker almost <strong>full access</strong> to the CAN

the method in this chapter was conducted by using the <strong>MS Threat modeling tool</strong> along with the <strong>template designed</strong> for the automotive industry, and this was not done before.</p><p>The <strong>template</strong> used with the <strong>MS Threat modeling tool</strong> has shown to be very useful and adaptable, where further work may allow this template to be used on even more low-level software applications.</p><p>The results generated by the tool described in this chapter are maybe not completely comprehensive but they clearly show the extent of vulnerabilities of an AUTOSAR-based software application.</p><p>Even though the application in question, the vehicle’s interior lights, does not seem like something worth analyzing, one can just imagine driving down

It refers to the interconnected communication systems within a vehicle, which enable different electronic control units (ECUs), sensors, and devices to share data and work together.</p><p>The <strong>central gateway-based architecture</strong> in an IVN serves as a hub that connects all components of the network. It ensures smooth communication by translating data between different network protocols (e.g., CAN, LIN, FlexRay, Ethernet) that might otherwise be incompatible. This architecture enhances data flow and ensures interoperability within the vehicle&#39;s diverse systems.</p><p><strong>IVN</strong> 指的是 <strong>车载网络（In-Vehicle Network）</strong>，即车辆内部的互联通信系统，用于使不同的电子控制单元（ECU）、传感器和设备之间能够共享数据并协同工作。</p><p>在车载网络中，<strong>基于中央网关的架构</strong> 充当整个网络的枢纽。它通过翻译不同网络协议（如 CAN、LIN、FlexRay、以太网）之间的数据，确保这些原本不兼容的协议之间能够顺畅通信。该架构改善了数据流动性，并确保车辆内部各种系统之间的互操作性。</p></blockquote><h2 id="_5-6-conclusion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-6-conclusion"><span>5.6 CONCLUSION</span></a></h2><ul><li>In this chapter, we adapted two threat modeling methods from the computer industry in order to better fit the needs of the automotive industry.</li><li>The next step was to <strong>apply</strong> these methods to the <strong>connected car and the underlying software architecture</strong>, which in turn generated valuable results that were carefully validated.</li><li>The entire work was done with the support of domain experts from different companies that have extensive knowledge in this field.</li><li><strong>TARA</strong> was used to provide a <strong>high-level overview of threats</strong> in the area of connected vehicles while <strong>STRIDE</strong> was used to <strong>evaluate a specific functionality of the vehicle</strong>.</li><li>The three libraries created by the TARA method and the template used by the STRIDE method would be a good starting point for any future application.</li><li>Finally, it is important to learn from the mistakes made by the computer industry, but it is also vital to recognize which threat modeling methods and which security mechanisms from the computer industry can be applied to the automotive industry.</li></ul>',134)]))}const A=t(b,[["render",v],["__file","Week05.html.vue"]]),S=JSON.parse('{"path":"/302/Week05.html","title":"Chapter 5: AUTOSAR Embedded Security in Vehicles","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"OBJECTIVES","slug":"objectives","link":"#objectives","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"5.1 OVERVIEW","slug":"_5-1-overview","link":"#_5-1-overview","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"5.2 INTRODUCTION","slug":"_5-2-introduction","link":"#_5-2-introduction","children":[{"level":3,"title":"5.2.1.1 TARA","slug":"_5-2-1-1-tara","link":"#_5-2-1-1-tara","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"5.2.1.2 STRIDE","slug":"_5-2-1-2-stride","link":"#_5-2-1-2-stride","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"5.2.1.3 AUTOSAR","slug":"_5-2-1-3-autosar","link":"#_5-2-1-3-autosar","children":[]}]},{"level":2,"title":"5.3 THREAT MODELS FOR THE AUTOMOTIVE DOMAIN","slug":"_5-3-threat-models-for-the-automotive-domain","link":"#_5-3-threat-models-for-the-automotive-domain","children":[{"level":3,"title":"5.3.1 Adaptation of TARA","slug":"_5-3-1-adaptation-of-tara","link":"#_5-3-1-adaptation-of-tara","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"TAL Library","slug":"tal-library","link":"#tal-library","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"MOL Library","slug":"mol-library","link":"#mol-library","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"5.3.2 ADAPTATION OF STRIDE","slug":"_5-3-2-adaptation-of-stride","link":"#_5-3-2-adaptation-of-stride","children":[]}]},{"level":2,"title":"5.4 APPLYING THE ADAPTED THREAT MODELS TO THE AUTOMOTIVE DOMAIN","slug":"_5-4-applying-the-adapted-threat-models-to-the-automotive-domain","link":"#_5-4-applying-the-adapted-threat-models-to-the-automotive-domain","children":[{"level":3,"title":"5.4.1 TARA: Methodology and Tools","slug":"_5-4-1-tara-methodology-and-tools","link":"#_5-4-1-tara-methodology-and-tools","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"5.4.1 TARA: Threat Agent Library (TAL)","slug":"_5-4-1-tara-threat-agent-library-tal","link":"#_5-4-1-tara-threat-agent-library-tal","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"5.4.1 TARA: Methods and Objectives Library (MOL)","slug":"_5-4-1-tara-methods-and-objectives-library-mol","link":"#_5-4-1-tara-methods-and-objectives-library-mol","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"5.4.1 TARA: Common Exposure Library (CEL)","slug":"_5-4-1-tara-common-exposure-library-cel","link":"#_5-4-1-tara-common-exposure-library-cel","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"5.4.2 STRIDE","slug":"_5-4-2-stride","link":"#_5-4-2-stride","children":[]}]},{"level":2,"title":"5.5 RESULTS","slug":"_5-5-results","link":"#_5-5-results","children":[{"level":3,"title":"5.5.1 TARA","slug":"_5-5-1-tara","link":"#_5-5-1-tara","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"5.5.2 STRIDE","slug":"_5-5-2-stride","link":"#_5-5-2-stride","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"5.5.4 DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK","slug":"_5-5-4-discussion-and-future-work","link":"#_5-5-4-discussion-and-future-work","children":[]}]},{"level":2,"title":"4.3 IN-VEHICLE COMMUNICATION","slug":"_4-3-in-vehicle-communication","link":"#_4-3-in-vehicle-communication","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"5.6 CONCLUSION","slug":"_5-6-conclusion","link":"#_5-6-conclusion","children":[]}],"git":{"updatedTime":1731816642000},"filePathRelative":"302/Week05.md"}');export{A as comp,S as data};
