INTRODUCTION</span></a></h2><p>Transportation cyber-physical systems (TCPS) have the potential to generate, process and exchange significant amounts of security-critical, safety-critical and privacy-sensitive information, which makes them attractive targets for cybercriminals.</p><p>TCPS utilise a wide variety of software, hardware and physical components, interconnected by communications protocols.</p><p>Computational and physical components (e.g., sensors and actuators) often interface with humans, and include a mix of digital and analog subsystems, with interactions in real time (especially where safety and time-critical functions are needed).</p><p>Cyber-physical systems will underpin critical infrastructure, intelligent transport systems and autonomous vehicles and form the basis for emerging smart city fabrics.</p><p>TCPS integrate a broad range of immature and proprietary technologies, incomplete (or missing) standards, and components that may have little or no security built in by design.</p><p>Whilst the focus is still very much on safety, the industry is now waking up to the idea that safety cannot be assured without security, and we must incorporate best security practises into TCPS projects from the outset.</p><p>The complexity, heterogeneity and immaturity of TCPS leave them vulnerable to new classes of cyberthreat, with attacks that have the potential to cause significant physical and economic damage, as well as threaten human lives.</p><h2 id="_2-basic-concepts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-basic-concepts"><span>2. BASIC CONCEPTS</span></a></h2><p>TCPS will become a critical part of national infrastructure, where the risks exposed have the potential to become national or even global issues.</p><p>TCPS overlap with a number of domains and yet introduces new paradigms: however, there are important lessons to be learnt from cybersecurity best practices in traditional infrastructures such as enterprise, Telco and industrial.</p><p>The fundamental security issues raised by TCPS are not necessarily new; however, advances in technology, increased use of low-power components (often with weak security controls) and new service models make it important to employ a different approach to protect data, people and infrastructure against emerging threats.</p><p>New vulnerabilities will continue to be exposed and exploited, and given the potential attraction of TCPS to adversaries (ranging from lone hackers, organised crime, to nation-state sponsored groups), we should anticipate that ever more sophisticated threats will continue to surface.</p><h3 id="_2-1-threats" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-1-threats"><span>2.1 THREATS</span></a></h3><ul><li>At a high level we can consider a threat taxonomy that has significant overlap with many other domains.</li><li>Fig. 5.1 provides a high-level classification for threat classes, partly based on work by the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security.</li><li>Most of these threat classes are applicable to TCPS, although their relative ease, frequency and implementation will vary depending upon the specific transport domain and systems deployed.</li></ul><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="image-20241006010731070"></p><h3 id="_2-2-adversaries" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-2-adversaries"><span>2.2 ADVERSARIES</span></a></h3><p>In cybersecurity, adversaries exist in several forms (often referred to as profiles), and they should be considered individually when assessing the scope of risk, vulnerability and threat.</p><p>We may consider a number of important classifications and attributes when profiling an attacker, such as the following:</p><ul><li>Powerful or weak adversary (e.g., lone actor, computer expert, organised crime, statesponsored teams of experts)</li><li>Resources available to adversaries (e.g., access to finance, machines, malware tools) - External or internal to the system (e.g., remote attack or installed keylogger)</li><li>External or internal to an organisation (e.g., insider threat, social engineering)</li></ul><h2 id="_2-3-confidentiality-integrity-and-availability" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-3-confidentiality-integrity-and-availability"><span>2.3 CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY AND AVAILABILITY</span></a></h2><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="image-20241006010930990"></p><h2 id="_2-4-risk" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-4-risk"><span>2.4 RISK</span></a></h2><p>Cybersecurity is not simply about cryptography; it is about assessing the risk of undesirable actions happening in a given context, and deploying appropriate safeguards and countermeasures (security controls) to militate such risk.</p><p>In enterprise security, for example, we may use a method called annual loss expectancy (ALE) to quantify and manage risk, which broadly follows the methodology listed below:</p><ol><li>Identity and prioritise assets (e.g., business-and mission-critical systems, intellectual property, personally identifiable information (PII), customer contact lists, etc.).</li><li>Identify major threats and vulnerabilities.</li><li>Estimate the probability of threats against the value of asset being compromised (using probabilities which often rely on domain expertise or industry datasets).
