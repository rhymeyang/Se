Coordination between cybersecurity engineering and expertise from other disciplines can support the in-depth analysis and mitigation of specific cybersecurity risks (cf. ISO/TR 4804 [6]). Cybersecurity monitoring, remediation and incident response activities complement concept and product development activities as a reactive approach acknowledging the changing conditions in the environment (e.g. new attack technologies) and the ongoing need to identify and manage weaknesses and vulnerabilities in road vehicle E/E systems.</p><p>A defence-in-depth approach can be used to mitigate cybersecurity risk. The defence-in-depth approach utilizes layers of cybersecurity controls to improve the cybersecurity of the vehicle.

This document defines requirements in a generic manner such that it can be applied to a variety of items and components. In addition, tailoring can be applied (see 6.4.3) that is based on a rationale and is defined in the cybersecurity plan. Examples of when tailoring can be used include:</p><ul><li>reuse (see 6.4.4),</li><li>component out-of-context (see 6.4.5),</li><li>use of an off-the-shelf component (see 6.4.6),</li><li>update (see 13.4).</li></ul><p>Reuse of items and components is a possible development strategy that can be applied, with or without modifications to an item, component, or their operational environment. However, modifications can introduce vulnerabilities that might not have been considered for the original item or component. Furthermore, there might have been a change in known attacks, for example:</p><ul><li>an evolution of attack techniques,</li><li>newly emerged vulnerabilities, e.g. learned from cybersecurity monitoring (see 8.3) and/or cybersecurity event evaluation (see 8.4), or</li><li>a change of the assets since the original development.</li></ul><p>If the original item or component was developed in accordance with this document, the reuse of that item or component is based on the existing work products. If the item or component was not originally developed in accordance with this document, the reuse can be based on the existing documentation with a rationale.</p><p>A component can be developed out-of-context, i.e. based on an assumed context. An organization can develop generic components for different applications and for different customers, prior to engagement or commercial agreement with a customer. The supplier can make assumptions about the context and intended use. Based on this, the supplier can derive requirements for the out-of-context development. For example, a microcontroller can be developed out-of-context.</p><p>An off-the-shelf component is a component that is not developed on behalf of a specific customer and that can be used without modification of its design or implementation, e.g. a third-party software library, an open source software component. An off-the-shelf component is not assumed to have been developed in accordance with this document.</p><p>Figure 5 shows that both an off-the-shelf component and an out-of-context component can be integrated into an item or component in accordance with this document. The integration can involve activities similar to reuse analysis in 6.4.4, and if changes are made to address invalid assumptions then change management (see 5.4.4) applies. The changes can be made to a component that is intended to be integrated and/or to the component or item that is the target of the integration.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt="image-20241027002030660"></p><p><strong>Figure 5</strong> — Integration of off-the-shelf and out-of-context components</p><p>The cybersecurity case (see 6.4.7) is an input to a cybersecurity assessment and to the release for post- development.</p><p>The cybersecurity assessment (see 6.4.8) judges independently the cybersecurity of an item or component and is an input for the decision to the release for post-development (see 6.4.9).</p><h3 id="_6-2-objectives" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-2-objectives"><span>6.2 Objectives</span></a></h3><p>The objectives of this clause are to:</p><ul><li>a) assign the responsibilities regarding the project’s cybersecurity activities;</li><li>b) plan the cybersecurity activities, including the definition of the tailored cybersecurity activities;

Cybersecurity incident response occurs when an organization invokes it as part of vulnerability management (see 8.6). Updates are changes made to an item or component during post-development and can include additional information, e.g. technical specifications, integration manuals, user manuals. Organizations can issue updates for various reasons, e.g. addressing vulnerabilities or safety issues, providing functional improvements. The work products concerning updates are documented as work products of other clauses. Modifications of items or components that are in the concept, product development or production phases are covered by change management (see 5.4.4) instead of this clause. 13.2 Objectives The objectives of this clause are to: a) determine and implement remedial actions for cybersecurity incidents; and b) maintain cybersecurity during and after updates to items or components after production until their end of cybersecurity support. 13.3 Cybersecurity incident response 13.3.1 Inputs 13.3.1.1 Prerequisites None. 13.3.1.2 Further supporting information The following information can be considered: — cybersecurity information related to the vulnerability that caused the cybersecurity incident response; — vulnerability analysis [WP-08-05]. 38 --<code>,,,`,</code>,,`, © ISO/SAE International 2021 – All rights reserved</p><p>--<code>,,,`,</code>,,<code>,``,,,</code>,,,`````,-<code>-</code>,,<code>,,</code>,<code>,,</code>--- 13.3.2 Requirements and recommendations [RQ-13-01] For each cybersecurity incident, a cybersecurity incident response plan shall be created that includes: a) remedial actions; NOTE 1 Remedial actions are determined by vulnerability management in 8.6. b) a communication plan; NOTE 2 The creation of a communication plan can involve internal interested parties, e.g. marketing or public relations, product development teams, legal, customer relations, quality management, purchasing.

An organization can end cybersecurity support for an item or component, but that item or component can still function as designed in the field. Both decommissioning and end of cybersecurity support can present cybersecurity implications, but those implications are considered separately. Decommissioning can occur without the organization’s knowledge and in such a way that decommissioning procedures cannot be enforced, therefore the act of decommissioning is out of scope of this document. End of cybersecurity support and decommissioning are considered in the concept and product development phases. --<code>,,,`,</code>,,<code>,``,,,</code>,,,`````,-<code>-</code>,,<code>,,</code>,<code>,,</code>--- 14.2 Objectives The objectives of this clause are to: a) communicate the end of cybersecurity support; and b) enable decommissioning of items and components with regard to cybersecurity. 14.3 End of cybersecurity support 14.3.1 Inputs None. 40 © ISO/SAE International 2021 – All rights reserved</p><p>14.3.2 Requirements and recommendations [RQ-14-01] A procedure shall be created to communicate to customers when an organization decides to end cybersecurity support for an item or component.

These methods and their work products are collectively known as a threat analysis and risk assessment (TARA) and are performed from the viewpoint of affected road users. The methods defined in this clause are generic modules that can be invoked systematically, and from any point in the lifecycle of an item or component: — asset identification (see 15.3); — threat scenario identification (see 15.4); — impact rating (see 15.5); — attack path analysis (see 15.6); ISO/SAE 21434:2021(E) © ISO/SAE International 2021 – All rights reserved 41</p><p>ISO/SAE 21434:2021(E) — attack feasibility rating (see 15.7); — risk value determination (see 15.8); and — risk treatment decision (see 15.9). Because these are generic modules, the work products defined in this clause are documented as parts of work products produced by other clauses. See Annex H for an illustration of these methods with a practical example. Organization specific scales for impact rating, attack feasibility rating and risk value determination can be applied and mapped to the corresponding scales defined in this document. 15.2 Objectives The objectives of this clause are to: a) identify assets, their cybersecurity properties and their damage scenarios; b) identify threat scenarios; c) determine the impact rating of damage scenarios; d) identify the attack paths that realize threat scenarios; e) determine the ease with which attack paths can be exploited; f) determine the risk values of threat scenarios; and g) select appropriate risk treatment options for threat scenarios. 15.3 Asset identification 15.3.1 Inputs --<code>,,,`,</code>,,<code>,``,,,</code>,,,`````,-<code>-</code>,,<code>,,</code>,<code>,,</code>--- 15.3.1.1 Prerequisites The following information shall be available: — item definition [WP-09-01]. 15.3.1.2 Further supporting information The following information can be considered: — cybersecurity specifications [WP-10-01]. 15.3.2 Requirements and recommendations [RQ-15-01] Damage scenarios shall be identified. NOTE 1 A damage scenario can include: — relation between the functionality of the item and the adverse consequence; — description of harm to the road user; and/or — relevant assets. 42 © ISO/SAE International 2021 – All rights reserved</p><p>ISO/SAE 21434:2021(E) [RQ-15-02] Assets with cybersecurity properties whose compromise leads to a damage scenario shall be identified. NOTE 2 The identification of assets can be based on: — analysing the item definition; — performing an impact rating; — deriving assets from threat scenarios; and/or — using predefined catalogues. EXAMPLE 1 The asset is personal information (customer personal preferences) stored in an infotainment system and its cybersecurity property is confidentiality. The damage scenario is disclosure of the personal information without the customer’s consent resulting from the loss of confidentiality. EXAMPLE2 The asset is data communication of the braking function and its cybersecurity property is integrity. The damage scenario is collision with following vehicle (rear-end collision) caused by unintended full braking when the vehicle is travelling at high speed. 15.3.3 Work products [WP-15-01] Damage scenarios, resulting from [RQ-15-01] [WP-15-02] Assets with cybersecurity properties, resulting from [RQ-15-02] 15.4 Threat scenario identification 15.4.1 Inputs The following shall be available: — item definition [WP-09-01]. 15.4.1.1 Prerequisites The following information can be considered: — cybersecurity specifications [WP-10-01]; — damage scenarios [WP-15-01]; — assets with cybersecurity properties [WP-15-02]. 15.4.1.2 Further supporting information [RQ-15-03] Threat scenarios shall be identified and include: 15.4.2 Requirements and recommendations — targeted asset; — compromised cybersecurity property of the asset; and — cause of compromise of the cybersecurity property. NOTE 1 Further information can be included or associated with a threat scenario, e.g. damage scenarios, technical interdependencies between assets, attackers, methods, tools, and attack surfaces. NOTE 2 The method for threat scenario identification can use group discussion and/or systematic approaches, for example: © ISO/SAE International 2021 – All rights reserved 43</p><p>ISO/SAE 21434:2021(E) — elicitation of malicious use cases resulting from reasonably foreseeable misuse and/or abuse; — threat modelling approaches based on frameworks such as EVITA [20], TVRA [21], PASTA [22], STRIDE (spoofing, tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service, elevation of privilege). NOTE 3 A damage scenario can correspond to multiple threat scenarios and a threat scenario can lead to multiple damage scenarios. EXAMPLE Spoofing of CAN messages for the braking ECU leads to loss of integrity of the CAN messages and thereby to loss of integrity of the braking function. 15.4.3 Work products [WP-15-03] Threat scenarios, resulting from [RQ-15-03] 15.5 Impact rating 15.5.1 Inputs The following shall be available: — damage scenarios [WP-15-01]. 15.5.1.1 Prerequisites The following information can be considered: — item definition [WP-09-01]; — assets with cybersecurity properties [WP-15-02]. 15.5.1.2 Further supporting information 15.5.2 Requirements and recommendations [RQ-15-04] The damage scenarios shall be assessed against potential adverse consequences for road users in the impact categories of safety, financial, operational, and privacy (S, F, O, P) respectively. NOTE 1 This document does not provide relationships (e.g. weighting) between different impact categories. NOTE 2 Additional impact categories can be considered. NOTE 3 If additional impact categories are considered, then the rationale and explanation of these categories can be shared in the supply chain in accordance with Clause 7. [RQ-15-05] The impact rating of a damage scenario shall be determined for each impact category to be one of the following: — severe; — major; — moderate; or — negligible. NOTE 4 Financial, operational and privacy related impacts can be rated in accordance with tables given in Annex F. [RQ-15-06] Safety related impact ratings shall be derived from ISO 26262-3:2018, 6.4.3.

[PM-15-07] If a damage scenario results in an impact rating and an argument can be made that every impact of another impact category is considered less critical, then further analysis for that other impact category may be omitted. EXAMPLE The safety impact of a damage scenario is rated “severe”, consequently financial impact of that damage scenario is not further analysed. 15.5.3 Work products [WP-15-04] Impact ratings with associated impact categories, resulting from [RQ-15-04] to [RQ- 15-06] 15.6 Attack path analysis --<code>,,,`,</code>,,<code>,``,,,</code>,,,`````,-<code>-</code>,,<code>,,</code>,<code>,,</code>--- 15.6.1 Inputs 15.6.1.1 Prerequisites The following information shall be available: — item definition [WP-09-01] or cybersecurity specifications [WP-10-01]; and NOTE The item definition is used if the attack path analysis is performed on an item, and the cybersecurity specifications are used if the attack path analysis is performed on a component. — threat scenarios [WP-15-03]. 15.6.1.2 Further supporting information The following information can be considered: — weaknesses from cybersecurity events [WP-08-04]; — weaknesses found during product development [WP-10-05]; — architectural design; — previously identified attack paths [WP-15-05], if available; — vulnerability analysis [WP-08-05]. 15.6.2 Requirements and recommendations [RQ-15-08] The threat scenarios shall be analysed to identify attack paths. NOTE 1 An attack path analysis can be based on: — top-down approaches that deduce attack paths by analysing the different ways in which a threat scenario could be realised, e.g. attack trees, attack graphs; and/or — bottom-up approaches that build attack paths from the vulnerabilities identified. NOTE 2 If a partial attack path does not lead to the realization of a threat scenario, the analysis of this partial attack path can be stopped. © ISO/SAE International 2021 – All rights reserved 45</p><p>ISO/SAE 21434:2021(E) [RQ-15-09] An attack path shall be associated with the threat scenarios that can be realized by the attack path. NOTE 3 In early stages of product development, attack paths are often incomplete or imprecise as specific implementation details are not yet known to be able to identify specific vulnerabilities. During product development, the attack paths can be updated as more information becomes available, e.g. after a vulnerability analysis. EXAMPLE — Threat scenario: spoofing of CAN messages for the braking ECU leads to loss of integrity of the CAN messages and thereby to loss of integrity of the braking function. — Attack path realizing the above threat scenario: i. the telematics ECU is compromised via the cellular interface; ii. the gateway ECU is compromised via CAN communication from the telematics ECU; iii. the gateway ECU forwards malicious braking request signals (unwanted rapid deceleration). 15.6.3 Work products [WP-15-05] Attack paths, resulting from [RQ-15-08] and [RQ-15-09] 15.7 Attack feasibility rating 15.7.1 Inputs The following information shall be available: — attack paths [WP-15-05]. 15.7.1.1 Prerequisites The following information can be considered: — architectural design; — vulnerability analysis [WP-08-05]. 15.7.2 Requirements and recommendations [RQ-15-10] For each attack path, the attack feasibility rating shall be determined as described in 15.7.1.2 Further supporting information Table 1.

Description High Medium Low Very low 46 © ISO/SAE International 2021 – All rights reserved Attack feasibility rating</p><p>[RC-15-11] The attack feasibility rating method should be defined based on one of the following approaches: a) attack potential-based approach; b) CVSS-based approach; or c) attack vector-based approach. NOTE 1 Selection of the approach can depend upon the phase in the lifecycle and available information. [RC-15-12] If an attack potential-based approach is used, the attack feasibility rating should be determined based on core factors including: a) elapsed time; b) specialist expertise; c) knowledge of the item or component; d) window of opportunity; and e) equipment. NOTE 2 The core attack potential factors can be derived from ISO/IEC 18045 [23]. NOTE 3 G.2 provides guidelines on determining attack feasibility based on attack potential. [RC-15-13] If a CVSS-based approach is used, the attack feasibility rating should be determined based on the exploitability metrics of the base metric group, including: a) attack vector; b) attack complexity; c) privileges required; and d) user interaction. NOTE 4 G.3 provides guidelines on determining attack feasibility based on a CVSS-based approach. [RC-15-14] If an attack vector-based approach is used, the attack feasibility rating should be determined based on evaluating the predominant attack vector (cf. CVSS [24] 2.1.1) of the attack path. NOTE 5 G.4 provides guidelines on determining attack feasibility based on an attack vector-based approach. NOTE 6 During the early stages of development (e.g. concept phase), when there is insufficient information to identify specific attack paths, an attack vector-based approach can be suitable to estimate attack feasibility. 15.7.3 Work products [WP-15-06] Attack feasibility ratings, resulting from [RQ-15-10] 15.8 Risk value determination 15.8.1 Inputs The following information shall be available: — threat scenarios [WP-15-03]; © ISO/SAE International 2021 – All rights reserved 47 15.8.1.1 Prerequisites ISO/SAE 21434:2021(E)</p><p>ISO/SAE 21434:2021(E) — impact ratings with associated impact categories [WP-15-04]; and — attack feasibility ratings [WP-15-06]. None. 15.8.1.2 Further supporting information 15.8.2 Requirements and recommendations [RQ-15-15] For each threat scenario the risk value shall be determined from the impact of the associated damage scenarios and the attack feasibility of the associated attack paths. NOTE 1 If a threat scenario corresponds to more than one damage scenario and/or an associated damage scenario has impacts in more than one impact category, a separate risk value can be determined separately for each of those impact ratings. NOTE 2 If the threat scenario corresponds to more than one attack path, the associated attack feasibility ratings can be appropriately aggregated, e.g. the threat scenario is assigned the maximum of the attack feasibility ratings of the corresponding attack paths. [RQ-15-16] The risk value of a threat scenario shall be a value between (and including) 1 and 5, where a value of 1 represents minimal risk.

Cybersecurity and safety have the highest priority. The reward system supports and motivates the effective achievement of cybersecurity and penalizes those who take shortcuts that jeopardize cybersecurity. Cybersecurity personnel act as role models with a good sense for appropriateness and practical implementation that leads to trust in their actions by the entire organization. The process provides adequate checks and balances, e.g. the appropriate degree of independence in cybersecurity assessment. Proactive attitude towards cybersecurity, e.g.: — cybersecurity issues are discovered and resolved from the earliest stage in the product lifecycle (cybersecurity by design); — the organization is prepared to react fast to vulnerabilities or incidents in the field. The required resources for cybersecurity are allocated. Skilled resources have the competence commensurate with the activity assigned. Examples indicative of a weak cybersecurity culture </code>,,<code>,``,,,</code>,,,`````,-<code>-</code>,,<code>,,</code>,<code>,,</code>--- Accountability for decisions related to cybersecurity is not traceable. Performance (of the implemented functionality or feature), cost or schedule take precedence over cybersecurity. The reward system favours cost and schedule over cy- bersecurity. Cybersecurity personnel force inappropriate and very strict adherence to cybersecurity without considering specific needs of projects/activities. Personnel assessing cybersecurity and its governing processes are influenced unduly by those responsible for executing the processes. Passive attitude towards cybersecurity, e.g.: — heavy dependence on testing at the end of the development; — not being prepared for potential weaknesses or incidents in the field; — management reacting only when there is a cybersecurity incident in production, in the field or if there is a lot of attention in the media about competitor products. The required resources for cybersecurity are not allocated. 52 © ISO/SAE International 2021 – All rights reserved</p><p>— Dissenter is ostracized or labelled as “not a team player” (e.g. uncooperative, intransigent, toxic person).
