But some provide active defense. One common active defense method is the implementation of honeypots. In this lesson, I&#39;m going to go over how you can implement honeypots and the different types you have to choose from.</p><p>Honeypots&#39; Purpose 00:20-00:43 A honeypot&#39;s purpose is to look like a legitimate network resource to entice an attacker to go after it. Honeypots trap attackers in an isolated environment where they can be monitored and kept from compromising important network systems. The honeypot tricks the attacker into believing that they&#39;re causing actual damage to the system, which enables the security team to analyze the attacker&#39;s behavior.</p><p>Honeypot Characteristics 00:43-01:06 Honeypots should be heavily monitored so you&#39;re aware of the activity being captured and so that you can see the early warning signs of a larger attack. A honeypot&#39;s logging capability is far greater than other network security tools and captures raw packet-level data, including keystrokes. The captured information is highly valuable because it contains malicious traffic with few false positives.</p><p>Physical vs. Virtual 01:06-01:45 When you&#39;re in the process of implementing a honeypot, you first need to decide which type of honeypot you want to set up. Honeypots can be either physical or virtual devices.</p><p>Physical honeypots have three main characteristics: they&#39;re actual devices, they have an IP address, and they&#39;re placed on the network. Physical honeypots usually provide the highest level of interaction with attackers. Virtual honeypots are simulated on a physical device. These are more cost-effective because you can simulate multiple honeypots on a single device. The downside to a virtual honeypot is that they attract less interactivity because it&#39;s easier for an attacker to tell that they&#39;re decoys.</p><p>Honeypot Placement 01:45-02:29 Deciding where to place the honeypot is an important decision as well. You want the honeypot to look like a real network device, but you also need to make sure the honeypot itself doesn&#39;t end up becoming a threat to your network.</p><p>Here, for example, the honeypot on the outside of the firewall poses less of a threat to internal security, but an attacker might quickly realize what they&#39;re actually dealing with. Putting the honeypot on the inside of the firewall might look and feel like a real network entity to an attacker. The problem is that if you misconfigure things, it could pose a security risk. For a honeypot to be truly successful, it must interact like a real device. So carefully weigh the pros and cons as you decide placement on each individual network.</p><p>Honeypot Types 02:29-04:14 Once you&#39;ve decided on the location, you need to figure out which type to implement. You could consider rolling out honeypots that allow for different interaction levels.</p><p>A low-interaction honeypot simulates a small number of applications on a target network and relies on the emulation of service and programs found on a vulnerable system. This means it can&#39;t be compromised completely and is generally set to collect information about attacks, like network probes and worms. These honeypots are very easy to set up and require little maintenance and oversight. A medium-interaction honeypot simulates real applications and services. These honeypots are more realistic than low-interaction honeypots, so they&#39;re able to analyze more complex attacks. They do require more maintenance and oversight, though.</p><p>You can also implement a high-interaction honeypot. These honeypots don&#39;t simulate anything but instead run actual services on real computers. A honeynet is a prime example of this. This is an entire network that&#39;s set up to entice an attacker while monitoring activity like encrypted sessions, file uploads, and more. These systems can also control the attacker&#39;s activity by implementing a honeywall gateway. A honeywall gateway allows inbound traffic but controls outbound traffic. High-interaction honeypots require the highest level of maintenance and oversight, but they can capture much more data than the others.</p><p>We can further classify honeypots based on their purpose and deception technology. Some common classifications are: research honeypots, production honeypots, malware honeypots, and database honeypots.</p><p>As a security analyst, you should understand a honeypot&#39;s purpose and be able to select the appropriate type for your organizational needs.</p><p>Summary 04:14-04:41 That&#39;s it for this lesson. In this lesson, we first looked at the purpose for using a honeypot. Next, we discussed the differences between a physical and virtual honeypot, and where to place them on the network. Then we looked at the different types of honeypots available. We ended by discussing how we can classify honeypots based on the interaction level we want an attacker to have and on the deception technology we&#39;re using.</p><h3 id="_3-4-2-honeypot-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-4-2-honeypot-facts"><span>3.4.2 Honeypot Facts</span></a></h3><p>This lesson covers the following topics:</p><ul><li>Honeypots</li><li>Types of honeypots</li></ul><h4 id="honeypots" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#honeypots"><span>Honeypots</span></a></h4><p>A honeypot is a decoy network or resource set up to entice a hacker to attack it so that a security analyst can study the attack methods.

They don&#39;t want to spend their time attacking a system that&#39;s designed to catch them, so a honeypot is only useful if it remains undetected. If an attacker does detect the honeypot, he or she will simply ignore it and move on. In this lesson, I&#39;ll go over some of the different honeypots you can implement and how an attacker might detect them.</p><p>Honeypot Detection 00:25-00:47 Since there are many ways to implement honeypots, attackers need to know how each type of honeypot works and how to detect them. One type of honeypot is known as a sticky honeypot, or tarpit. These honeypots are designed to take a long time to respond and essentially cause the attacker&#39;s machine to get stuck. These tarpits work at different levels of the OSI model.</p><p>Layer 7 Tarpit 00:47-01:10 A Layer 7 tarpit reacts to incoming packet requests slowly. A common implementation of this tarpit is to slow down spam emails and delay email server authentication to increase email transfer times. This makes sending spam mail unattractive to the attacker. Layer 7 tarpits can be quickly detected by measuring the latency in response times.</p><p>Layer 4 Tarpit 01:10-01:43 Layer 4 tarpits use the TCP/IP stack and are generally used to slow the spread of worms, backdoors, and other attacks. This tarpit first accepts the incoming connection and then spontaneously switches the TCP windows size to zero. This means the attacker is unable to terminate the connection because they can&#39;t send a disconnect request. Attackers can detect this tarpit by analyzing the TCP window size. If the tarpit acknowledges incoming packets, but the window size is zero, that&#39;s a red flag for the attacker.</p><p>Layer 2 Tarpit 01:43-02:00 The final type is a Layer 2 tarpit. These are used to block attacks that occur from inside a network. These tarpits use a special MAC address that acts as a sort of black hole to trap the attacker. If an attacker sees this MAC address, they&#39;ll probably know right away that they&#39;re in a honeypot.</p><p>VMWare 02:00-02:47 Honeypots are often run inside virtual machines to save on resources and security. One of the more popular virtualization programs is VMware. VMware is a virtual machine software used to simultaneously launch multiple instances of operating systems on the same physical machine. To detect VMware, attackers look at the hardware, since this is what VMware emulates. Attackers look for specific display adapters and network cards. Another VMware detection method is to cause an illegal instruction. As the VMware&#39;s exception handler checks to see if the instruction must be handled by VMware itself or by a specific handler, the attacker can watch the subsequent reaction to make an analysis. VMware takes longer to process the instruction than a host machine.</p><p>Honeyd 02:47-03:13 Honeyd is another widely used honeypot. It makes it easy to create thousands of honeypots, and it can distract potential attackers. For example, if a network only has three real servers, but one server is</p><p>running Honeyd, the network appears to have hundreds to an observer. This means that when you use Honeyd, the attacker has to do more research to determine which servers are real. Otherwise, they might get caught in a honeypot.</p><p>User-Mode-Linux (UML) 03:13-03:36 User-Mode-Linux, or UML, is an open-source tool used to create virtual machines and honeypots. One of the big issues with UML is that it doesn&#39;t use a real hard disk, but instead uses a fake IDE device. This means that attackers can identify the presence of UML honeypots by analyzing specific files in the OS that contain UML-specific information.</p><p>Bait and Switch Honeypot System 03:36-04:05 A bait and switch honeypot system works with other IDS software, mainly Snort, to detour suspected malicious traffic into a honeypot that mirrors or closely resembles the real network without the attacker knowing. The attacker needs to be skilled enough to identify the detour or detect that they&#39;re in a honeypot when they&#39;re redirected.</p><p>These are just a few of the honeypot types that you can implement. As a security analyst, you should know which type of honeypot you&#39;ve implemented and how an attacker might detect it.</p><p>Summary 04:05-04:25 That&#39;s it for this lesson. In this lesson, we covered a few of the common honeypots, such as tarpits, virtual honeypots, Honeyd, UML, and bait and switch honeypots. We also looked at how an attacker might detect each type and attempt to avoid them.</p><h3 id="_3-4-4-evade-honeypots-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-4-4-evade-honeypots-facts"><span>3.4.4 Evade Honeypots Facts</span></a></h3><p>Honeypots are useful only if an attacker does not know the attack is on a honeypot.

The idea behind taking an active defense approach is to change the odds to be asymmetrically in your organization&#39;s favor. Hopefully, these strategies end up helping a security analyst take up less time and resources to do their job, and make an attacker have to use more time and resources on their end. The expectation is that attackers will just move on to easier targets. Anti-malware software is an important part of this.</p><p>Before we discuss anti-malware, remember that the first line of defense is always user intervention. Train users in your organization to be savvy about their online interactions, like not opening attachments from unfamiliar senders or clicking on links from phishing emails.</p><p>Antivirus Software 01:06-01:58 Now, let&#39;s look at antivirus software. Often, the terms antivirus and anti-malware are used interchangeably, but they&#39;re not the same thing. Antivirus software protects against more established threats, such as viruses, worms, Trojan horses, rootkits, keyloggers, backdoors, and botnets. Anti-malware typically focuses on more recent threats.</p><p>Cybersecurity researchers write rules, such as YARA rules, to discover malware signatures. When discovered, the signatures are added to antivirus databases or lists.</p><p>Antivirus software scans incoming files in the background and compares their signatures with its own database. Keeping your antivirus software updated is crucial, as new threats are constantly being added to the list. When it detects malware, antivirus software blocks it from infecting the system.</p><p>Anti-Malware Software 01:58-02:46 Even though there&#39;s a lot of crossover between antivirus and anti-malware, anti-malware software generally uses heuristic-based malware detection for zero-day attacks and second-generation malware. The software can also remove malware that&#39;s already infected a system.</p><p>In heuristic analysis, artificial intelligence and machine learning use algorithms based on risk determined by if/then statements or decision rules. The analysis also looks for code that&#39;s similar to known malware code and flags it for testing. Many anti-malware software options analyze suspicious programs by running them in a virtual machine or sandbox to keep the environment controlled. This scanning method helps anti-malware software identify signs of a compromised system.</p><p>Anti-Malware Tools 02:46-03:47 Besides antivirus and anti-malware software, there are other tools that security analysts use to protect their networks. These include integrity checkers, interceptors, and code emulation. Integrity checkers establish a baseline and keep an eye on system changes that shouldn&#39;t be taking place. These programs also alert users to the possibility that there&#39;s malware on the system. The biggest drawback to this method is that not all integrity checkers can analyze the changes and determine whether they&#39;re due to a system failure or to malware.</p><p>Interceptors are mainly used against logic bombs and Trojans. For example, if a request for network access is made, the interceptor notifies the user and asks to continue. Code emulation is when anti-malware software opens a virtual environment to mimic CPU and RAM activity. Malware code is executed in this environment instead of on the physical processor. This method works well against polymorphic and metamorphic viruses.</p><p>Summary 03:47-04:09 That&#39;s it for this lesson. In this lesson, we discussed using an active defense approach to security. Then we looked at the difference between antivirus and anti-malware software. We finished by discussing additional anti-malware tools that can help you defend against malware.</p><h3 id="_3-4-6-anti-malware-software-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-4-6-anti-malware-software-facts"><span>3.4.6 Anti-Malware Software Facts</span></a></h3><p>Malware programs are a common way attackers gain access to systems.

If an organization uses a basic defensive approach, the system analyst will spend more time and resources defending against attacks. The defense will simply be a reaction to malware infections that are discovered. This allows attackers the ability to spends less time and resources creating or instigating attacks. Attackers know there is no defense until the intrusion occurs, and the organization is most likely vulnerable to new malware attacks.</p><p>An active defense approach seeks to asymmetrically put the odds in the security analyst&#39;s favor. Active defense includes offensive strategies to implement maneuverability to sensitive data, the use honeypots to learn attacker&#39;s capabilities, and implement anti-malware defenses. This also includes actively hardening assets against new malware attacks via up-to-date software and patches. In an active defense approach, the system analyst will actually spend less time and resources defending against attacks. It will also result in less time spent recovering from attacks by stopping them or preventing them from spreading. As a result, the attacker will spend more time and resources creating or instigating attacks.</p><h4 id="antivirus-and-anti-malware-software" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#antivirus-and-anti-malware-software"><span>Antivirus and Anti-Malware Software</span></a></h4><p>Understanding the difference between antivirus and anti-malware software is an important concept in implementing an active defense.

These tools scan ranges of IP addresses for systems with interesting ports open, such as Telnet, Remote Desktop, SSH, and FTP. Many security analysts like to know who&#39;s gathering this kind of information, and there&#39;s a simple way to record reconnaissance attempts. In order to record these network scans, we need a computer whose sole purpose is to listen for connection attempts on interesting ports, then log the data about each attempt. This kind of system is called a honeypot. It looks appealing and hackable from the outside, but it&#39;s actually recording data about every remote user that attempts to connect. Today, we&#39;ll look at how to set up an extremely basic honeypot using a tool called Pentbox.</p><p>Pentbox 00:47-03:02 Pentbox is available online, but many people upload copies of the original program. When downloading tools, especially penetration tools, you have to be certain of the tool&#39;s integrity so you don&#39;t download malicious software. I&#39;ve already downloaded the tool and put it in a folder named pentbox, so let&#39;s open that now. From my Kali Linux machine, I&#39;ll open a terminal and navigate to ‘cd pentbox/&#39;. I&#39;ll list the folder&#39;s contents to make sure everything is there.</p><p>Pentbox is a Ruby script. Since Ruby is already installed on Kali, we just need to run the script. To do that, I&#39;ll type ‘./pentbox.rb&#39; and press Enter.</p><p>When it opens, we can see a variety of options. Pentbox does a lot of things. But right now, we&#39;re only interested in the honeypot utility, which is located under Network Tools. First, I&#39;ll select number 2, and then we&#39;ll select Honeypot, number 3.</p><p>After we&#39;ve selected the Honeypot utility, we&#39;re presented with the option to use either fast or manual configuration. I&#39;m going to select number 1, the Fast Autoconfiguration option, since the manual configuration only lets us change which port the tool listens on. It also lets us set the message to return to the requesting machine.</p><p>As soon as we press Enter, we&#39;re told that the honeypot has started running on port 80. Let&#39;s try connecting to it with Firefox to see what happens. I&#39;ll open Firefox and type ‘localhost&#39; in the address bar. We can see that the honeypot returns back a webpage that tells us access has been denied. Interestingly, the autoconfiguration option returns a line with a date and time. This doesn&#39;t change; actually, it represents the time the tool was started. Now that we&#39;ve connected to the page, let&#39;s see what Pentbox says.</p><p>Okay, I&#39;m back on my Kali Linux system. It looks like the honeypot utility is telling us quite a bit of information. The first line of each entry shows that there was a connection attempt and tells us what the IP address of the connecting machine was, as well as the connection time. After that, the honeypot utility tells us the header information that was received when the connection was made. This information includes both the web browser that was used and information about the type of operating system that connected.</p><p>Summary 03:02-03:24 So, there&#39;s a really simple overview of a honeypot&#39;s function. This is just a taste of what you can accomplish- there are many more robust tools available that can log information about connections on many different ports and protocols simultaneously, which is a goldmine of data that will help you keep your network safe.</p><h3 id="_3-4-8-scan-for-open-ports-with-netstat" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-4-8-scan-for-open-ports-with-netstat"><span>3.4.8 Scan for Open Ports with Netstat</span></a></h3><p>Click one of the buttons to take you to that part of the video.</p><p>Scan for Open Ports with Netstat 00:00-00:31 Netstat is a tool you can run on Windows or Linux to show active network connections on the local machine. Netstat is capable of showing the port, protocol, and state of each connection as well as the local and foreign IP addresses involved in the connection. If flags are specified, additional information can be shown. Since netstat is a command line application, let&#39;s open a prompt. I have a shortcut to PowerShell on the Desktop, so I&#39;ll start PowerShell and click Run as Administrator.</p><p>Use Netstat to View Connections and Open Ports 00:31-02:07 Alright. Aside from simply viewing active connections, we can see which ports the machine is listening on. This can be incredibly useful for discovering which protocols can be exploited on a machine. You do need to be familiar with what each port is commonly used for, but there are plenty of lists on the web that you can use for reference.</p><p>First, let&#39;s see what netstat tells us when we don&#39;t provide any flags. I&#39;ll just type in &#39;netstat&#39;.</p><p>Here we can see that we&#39;re only shown connections that are currently active or were recently active. In this case, they&#39;re mostly connections to the internet over port 443. When netstat knows the service that typically runs on a port, rather than providing the port number in the foreign address field, it shows the service name instead, such as https for port 443.</p><p>Let&#39;s clear the screen.</p><p>There&#39;s a good chance we may want to view some more information than just the basics. We&#39;re going to type &#39;netstat -a&#39; to see all connections and listening ports. Regardless of whether it&#39;s UDP or TCP, we&#39;ll see all connections on the system regardless of state.</p><p>Next, &#39;netstat -n&#39; displays all connections in numerical form, and &#39;netstat -o&#39; displays the process id associated with the connection. Now, it&#39;s possible to combine several flags together, such as &#39;netstat -ano&#39; to achieve the correct information you may be looking for.</p><p>If by chance we were troubleshooting and wanted to see an output every five seconds, we could do something like &#39;netstat -o 5&#39;. You can see here that every five seconds, it&#39;s giving us a new netstat output.</p><p>We&#39;re going cancel this and clear our screen.</p><p>Netstat Statistics 02:07-02:49 Not only can netstat provide you with port information, it can also give you more statistics than the GUI can provide. To display both Ethernet statistics and the statistics of all protocols, type &#39;netstat -e -s&#39;. Let&#39;s scroll back up and take a look. We&#39;re not going to explain everything in this output. However, it shows that you received or sent IPV4, IPV6, ICMPv4, ICMPv6, TCP, and UDP.</p><p>We&#39;ve decided that we only want to see the TCP statistics instead. So to do that, let&#39;s type &#39;netstat -s -p TCP&#39;. Now, we have only the statistics we&#39;ve requested.</p><p>Summary 02:49-03:04 That&#39;s it for this demo. In this demo, we discussed how to use netstat to view active and listening ports. We also showed how we can gather statistics on all network connections.</p><h3 id="_3-4-9-track-port-usage-with-tcpview" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-4-9-track-port-usage-with-tcpview"><span>3.4.9 Track Port Usage with TCPView</span></a></h3><p>Click one of the buttons to take you to that part of the video.</p><p>TCPView 00:00-00:29 TCPView is a tool you can run on Windows to quickly and easily discover which network ports are in use on the local machine. In addition to showing which ports are in use, TCPView also tracks the local and remote addresses the computer is talking on, as well as how much data is traveling to and from each process. This can be incredibly useful for troubleshooting a machine&#39;s network usage, or even for discovering hidden services talking to the internet in the background.</p><p>Set up the Scenario 00:29-00:48 Consider this scenario: you get onto your computer and notice that your downloads are running slowly. You don&#39;t think you should be having a lot of network traffic, but to find out for sure, you open up TCPView to diagnose the traffic. I have a icon here, on the desktop, so I&#39;ll double-click it to open up the program. I&#39;ll say Yes to the user account control.</p><p>Use TCPView to Diagnose a Problem 00:48-02:13 In TCPView, there are quite a few columns that contain a lot of information, so let&#39;s go through them quickly.</p><p>The Process column tells us the name of the program making a network connection, and the PID column tells us the process ID that Windows uses to track it.</p><p>The Protocol column is useful for troubleshooting, but it primarily exists to make sure we have the complete data set.</p><p>The Local Address and Local Port column tell us the address and port number of the machine communicating with the server detailed in the Remote Address and Remote Port columns. TCPView will attempt to tell us the name of the protocol running on a port if it knows what typically runs on it.</p><p>For instance, we can see that the Local Port column has both port numbers and the names of protocols, such as Netbios.</p><p>The State column is useful for troubleshooting network connections that seem to have trouble connecting or staying connected.</p><p>The columns that will help us troubleshoot why our download speed is slow are the Sent and Received Packets and Bytes columns. These show us how much data is communicated for each connection listed.</p><p>Let&#39;s sort by most data received to see if our problem is related to a large download hidden somewhere.</p><p>Look at that! qbittorrent is sending and receiving a lot of data. That reminds me that I think I left a download running yesterday. Maybe I forgot to stop it from uploading to others, let&#39;s check. I&#39;ll come down here to the system tray and check the qbittorrent program. It looks like I was right. I forgot to stop it from seeding the Kali Linux installer download. So, I&#39;ll pause uploading, and that should take care of the issue.</p><p>Summary 02:13-02:31 And that&#39;s it for this demo. We explored the TCPView interface to diagnose network traffic problems. We discussed the different columns in the program, sorted by the Sent and Received column, and discovered a program using a large amount of bandwidth.</p>',41)]))}const d=n(l,[["render",r],["__file","3.4.html.vue"]]),u=JSON.parse('{"path":"/CyberDefensePro/3.4.html","title":"3.4 Honeypots","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{"lang":"zh-CN","title":"3.4 Honeypots","description":"some description"},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Section 3.4 Honeypots","slug":"section-3-4-honeypots","link":"#section-3-4-honeypots","children":[{"level":3,"title":"3.4.1 Honeypots","slug":"_3-4-1-honeypots","link":"#_3-4-1-honeypots","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"3.4.2 Honeypot Facts","slug":"_3-4-2-honeypot-facts","link":"#_3-4-2-honeypot-facts","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"3.4.3 Evade Honeypots","slug":"_3-4-3-evade-honeypots","link":"#_3-4-3-evade-honeypots","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"3.4.4 Evade Honeypots Facts","slug":"_3-4-4-evade-honeypots-facts","link":"#_3-4-4-evade-honeypots-facts","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"3.4.5 Anti-Malware Software","slug":"_3-4-5-anti-malware-software","link":"#_3-4-5-anti-malware-software","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"3.4.6 Anti-Malware Software Facts","slug":"_3-4-6-anti-malware-software-facts","link":"#_3-4-6-anti-malware-software-facts","children":[]}]},{"level":2,"title":"Penetration Testing Method","slug":"penetration-testing-method","link":"#penetration-testing-method","children":[{"level":3,"title":"3.4.7 Detect Malicious Network Traffic with a Honeypot","slug":"_3-4-7-detect-malicious-network-traffic-with-a-honeypot","link":"#_3-4-7-detect-malicious-network-traffic-with-a-honeypot","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"3.4.8 Scan for Open Ports with Netstat","slug":"_3-4-8-scan-for-open-ports-with-netstat","link":"#_3-4-8-scan-for-open-ports-with-netstat","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"3.4.9 Track Port Usage with TCPView","slug":"_3-4-9-track-port-usage-with-tcpview","link":"#_3-4-9-track-port-usage-with-tcpview","children":[]}]}],"git":{"updatedTime":1746410797000},"filePathRelative":"CyberDefensePro/3.4.md"}');export{d as comp,u as data};
