We use security controls to reduce the risk of system threats. Part of your role as a security analyst is to be proactive and not reactive. You don&#39;t want to wait until it&#39;s too late to decide how to respond to an attack. You want to have controls in place that deter attackers and mitigate any attack&#39;s impact. These controls should be well-planned and align with your risk management strategy, which is why categories and control types provide an effective way to structure your controls.</p><p>Security Control Categories 00:38-01:16 The National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, has set up a method for classifying security controls. There are three security control categories: managerial, operational, and technical controls.</p><p>Managerial controls provide system oversight. Examples include security assessments, risk identification, and control-selection evaluation. Operational controls are usually implemented by people and could include security guards, employee training, or other non-technical procedures. Technical controls are system implementations and include software, hardware, and firmware.</p><p>Security Control Types 01:16-03:14 We further classify security controls by function. For example, we have preventative, detective, corrective, deterrent, physical, and compensating control types. Let&#39;s go through each one.</p><p>The goal of preventative controls is to harden a system against attacks and recognize and stop attacks as they occur. Access control lists, or ACLs, and anti-malware applications are examples of technical preventative controls. Administrative preventative controls could include policies and procedures.</p><p>Detective controls don&#39;t prevent access; they identify, log, and report incidents as they happen.</p><p>Corrective controls are things like a backup system to limit damage in the case of an incident.</p><p>Deterrent controls don&#39;t prevent access but discourage attackers from attempting access. Examples could be legal signs or warnings citing potential repercussions.</p><p>Physical controls are things like alarms, security cameras, and lights that could scare off attackers.</p><p>Gateways and guards are practical ways to use physical controls as well.</p><p>Compensating controls are a little different because they can use one or more of the other control types. Compensating controls are used when a recommended security control isn&#39;t practical. These compensating controls must provide equivalent protection.</p><p>For example, let&#39;s say a bank is required to have a separation of duties when it comes to deposits, but in one branch, there aren&#39;t enough employees to meet the requirement.</p><p>A compensating control might be specific accounting procedures regularly audited by another employee.</p><p>Most controls are preventative, detective, or corrective—but a few fall into the deterrent, physical, or compensating categories. While no combination is impenetrable, layering various controls can help delay an attack until it&#39;s detected.</p><p>Also, know that the term control efficiency refers to how long a control can delay an attack. This is a helpful measurement in the field of security analytics.</p><p>Security Control Evaluation 03:14-05:28 Evaluating security controls starts with looking at risks within your organization. After that, you can determine which security controls best mitigate the risks you&#39;ve identified. Your goal is to reduce all these risks to acceptable levels. Any activity dealing with computer networks—especially internet-connected ones—involves some form of risk. Depending on how you set a network up, there might be a lot of risk or not much at all. Here are a few factors to consider when determining the best security controls to implement.</p><p>The first is compatibility. You should assess whether the security control works with the existing infrastructure or requires new hardware or software.</p><p>Next is effectiveness. Does the control work well in your environment? If the control is only partially effective or doesn&#39;t provide much benefit, it might not be worth the cost.</p><p>Next, consider any regulatory compliance requirements impacted by the control. In other words, make sure you aren&#39;t breaking any laws. For example, if federal law requires you to maintain an archive of all email messages that come into your network, a spam reduction security control might delete messages that the law requires to be archived. Ensure the control doesn&#39;t violate your company policies, either.</p><p>Lastly, look at the security control&#39;s feasibility. This requires you to perform a cost-benefit analysis. For example, let&#39;s say you invest in some software and implement a security control that eliminates the risk of system malware. However, doing so makes systems so difficult to run that user productivity is severely affected. In addition, the malware protection is a resource hog and slows down even the fastest systems. On top of that, it also has a subscription model that charges per system per month.</p><p>Even though this security control is 100 percent effective, it isn&#39;t practical in cost or performance. In this scenario, the security control&#39;s impact drastically outweighs its benefits. You can identify issues immediately by performing a cost-benefit analysis beforehand and not wasting time.</p><p>Remember, it&#39;s impossible to eliminate all risk. Security is a tradeoff between usability and security. But by identifying the factors we discussed in this lesson and performing a cost-benefit analysis, you can find a balance between convenience and protection.</p><p>Summary 05:28-05:48 That&#39;s it for this lesson. In this lesson, we discussed managerial, operational, and technical security control categories. We reviewed six security control types: preventative, detective, corrective, deterrent, physical, and compensating. We also discussed factors to consider when you&#39;re evaluating security controls.</p><h3 id="_2-3-2-security-control-categories-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-3-2-security-control-categories-facts"><span>2.3.2 Security Control Categories Facts</span></a></h3><p>This lesson covers the following topics:</p><ul><li>Security controls</li><li>Security control categories</li><li>Standards and frameworks</li><li>Security control testing</li></ul><h4 id="security-controls" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#security-controls"><span>Security Controls</span></a></h4><p>It is common to identify that many security controls are deployed quickly, often as a reactive response to newly identified threats. In the early years of cyber defense, this approach was practical. For example, firewalls provided quick and effective protection and were straightforward to deploy; the level of protection a simple firewall provided was much more comprehensive than what is needed today. As viruses and worms began to infect computer systems through the 1990s, organizations deployed antivirus software on workstations and servers. This approach was simple, effective, and solely focused on preventative measures. At the time, this approach worked.</p><p>As modern cyber threats have become increasingly sophisticated, the ability to implement relatively simple controls with high levels of protection is becoming much rarer. Current infrastructures are complicated and require layered security controls deployed structured and systematically. Additionally, in the early years of computing, organizations were far less dependent on technology resources, and technology risks were less severe.</p><h4 id="security-control-categories" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#security-control-categories"><span>Security Control Categories</span></a></h4><p>Security controls reduce the risk of loss and damage to an organization, including its computer systems. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has designed methods for classifying security controls. In this first method, each control is organized into different classes based on the dominant characteristics of the control.
