Model</span></a></h2><ul><li><strong>Networked Applications</strong>: <ul><li>Business applications are typically networked, allowing multiple users across locations to access centrally installed applications.</li><li>Data networks enable communication between central servers and user workstations, facilitating client-server and web-based applications.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Client-Server Model</strong>: <ul><li>This model includes a central application server, database servers, and user workstations.</li><li>The server handles requests from workstations, while the workstation manages user interactions and displays information.</li><li>Users can input, view, or edit information through the application.</li><li>The workstation processes inputs locally and sends them to the server, which updates and stores the data.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="web-based-applications-and-middleware-components" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#web-based-applications-and-middleware-components"><span>Web-Based Applications and Middleware Components</span></a></h2><ul><li><strong>Web-Based Applications</strong>: <ul><li>These applications are favored over client-server due to central business logic and lightweight data requirements.</li><li>Business logic resides on central servers; users only need browsers, which reduces maintenance.</li><li>Web-based applications are universally accessible across different operating systems, like Windows, macOS, and Linux.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Middleware</strong>: <ul><li>Middleware acts as a bridge, coordinating processes between servers and managing complex transactions.</li><li><strong>Types of middleware include</strong>: <ul><li><strong>TP Monitors</strong>: Manages business transactions across multiple servers.</li><li><strong>RPC Gateways</strong>: Facilitates communications between components using remote procedure calls.</li><li><strong>ORB Gateways</strong>: Manages transactions across distributed systems using CORBA or COM.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="challenges-of-client-server-applications" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#challenges-of-client-server-applications"><span>Challenges of Client-Server Applications</span></a></h2><ul><li><strong>Network Performance Issues</strong>: <ul><li>Client-server applications often create high data loads, slowing down the network, especially with multiple users.</li><li>Example: A single database query may return thousands of records to a workstation, consuming bandwidth and reducing efficiency.</li><li>High usage across workstations can lead to significant lag and application performance issues.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Workstation Software Updates</strong>: <ul><li>Synchronizing software updates across all workstations is challenging.</li><li>Updates must be applied simultaneously to maintain consistency, but some workstations may be offline or unavailable.</li><li>This inconsistency can lead to application malfunctions or incompatibility issues for users with outdated software versions.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Limitations and Shift to Web-Based Solutions</strong>: <ul><li>Due to these challenges, many organizations found client-server applications unsatisfactory.</li><li>The rise of the World Wide Web offered a more scalable and efficient alternative for multi-user applications.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="advantages-of-web-based-applications" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#advantages-of-web-based-applications"><span>Advantages of Web-Based Applications</span></a></h2><ul><li><strong>Centralized Business Logic</strong>: <ul><li>All business logic is stored on one or more centralized servers.</li><li>No need for workstation updates</li></ul></li><li><strong>Efficient Display Logic</strong>: <ul><li>User interfaces, like forms and lists, are created with HTML, a simple and universal markup language.</li><li>Reduces application complexity on workstations.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Low Network Demand</strong>: <ul><li>Web applications minimize data load, sending only essential display data to workstations.</li><li>Reduces bandwidth usage</li></ul></li><li><strong>Minimal Updates for Workstations</strong>: <ul><li>Workstations require only browser updates</li><li>Simplifies maintenance and ensures consistency across user devices.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Broad Compatibility</strong>: <ul><li>Runs on various operating systems (e.g., Unix, Windows, macOS, Chrome OS, Linux).</li><li>Offers flexibility and accessibility, supporting a range of devices without specific software requirements.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="understanding-business-resilience-in-it-systems" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor"

on the stability and continuity of IT systems and business applications that support critical business processes.</li><li>Ensures the ongoing functionality and survival of an organization during major disasters or disruptions.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Importance of Resilience in the Digital Era</strong>: <ul><li>With digital transformation (DX), business processes are increasingly dependent on information technology.</li><li>Enhancing IT resilience is essential to maintain organizational operations, minimize losses, and sustain productivity.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Core Elements of Business Resilience</strong>: <ul><li>Business Continuity Planning (BCP): Proactively addresses potential disruptions to reduce risk and ensure critical functions continue.</li><li>Disaster Recovery Planning (DRP): Outlines steps to recover IT systems and restore business operations after a disaster.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="understanding-disasters-in-business-continuity" tabindex="-1"><a

<ul><li>Disasters are unexpected, unplanned events that disrupt business operations, ranging from minor interruptions to complete operational shutdowns.</li><li>The impact of a disaster can be confined to a small area or spread over a wide region, affecting entire networks or specific functions within an organization.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Classification of Disasters</strong>: <ul><li><strong>Natural Disasters</strong>: Events originating from natural phenomena that occur without human intervention.</li><li><strong>Human-Made Disasters</strong>: Incidents caused directly or indirectly by human activity.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Understanding and classifying disasters aids in creating effective Business Continuity Planning (BCP) strategies that prepare organizations for
