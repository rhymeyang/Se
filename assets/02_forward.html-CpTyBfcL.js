The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization. SAE International is a global association of more than 128,000 engineers and related technical experts in the aerospace, automotive and commercial-vehicle industries. Standards from SAE International are used to advance mobility engineering throughout the world. The SAE Technical Standards Development Program is among the organization's primary provisions to those mobility industries it serves aerospace, automotive, and commercial vehicle. These works are authorized, revised, and maintained by the volunteer efforts of more than 9,000 engineers, and other qualified professionals from around the world. SAE subject matter experts act as individuals in the standards process, not as representatives of their organizations. Thus, SAE standards represent optimal technical content developed in a transparent, open, and collaborative process.
