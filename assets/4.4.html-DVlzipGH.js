Such sensitive data can mean the difference between a successful product launch and being beat to the punch by a competitor. In order for a company to remain competitive, their privileged information must remain hidden from those outside of their corporate network. The process of making sure this happens is called Data Loss Prevention (DLP).</p><p>DLP Software 00:30-01:13 DLP software acts like perimeter guards around a secure location. They have specific instructions about what kind of information to let out and what kind of information to let in. Anyone who is trying to break the rules will be stopped. DLP software flags certain kinds of information with different levels of security, such as &quot;confidential&quot; or &quot;critical&quot; to make sure that users do not accidentally share this information outside of the network. Common ways that this happens include an employee sending a critical file as an attachment on an email outside the company domain, or an employee uploading a critical file to the cloud, where it can then be seen by others. DLP software attempts to stop these kinds of leaks.</p><p>Insider Threats 01:13-02:19 The need for DLP software is driven in part by insider threats. This is a kind of risk that company insiders pose, because they have access to sensitive information. It is a security threat that originates from inside the company, instead of an attack from outside the company. Third-parties might bribe insiders to divulge sensitive information and the DLP software may be the only thing standing in their way.</p><p>There are two main categories of insider threats that a company&#39;s security team needs to look out for: turncloaks and pawns. Turncloaks are insiders who are maliciously stealing data and using it to hurt the company. They have legitimate credentials to access sensitive data, but they are abusing their privileges, often as a way to turn a profit. This can often happen as a means of revenge against a company when someone is punished or fired from a position.</p><p>A pawn, on the other hand, is a normal employee who makes a mistake that unwittingly divulges sensitive information that is later abused by someone else. The pawn did not willingly damage the company, but their actions led to someone else being able to do so.</p><p>Common Indicators 02:19-03:10 It is important to look for common indicators that a person is posing an insider threat. There are both digital clues that you can spot and behavioral clues in how the suspect is acting.</p><p>Some digital clues may be that the employee is obtaining a suspiciously large amount of data, that they are sending a lot of information to outsides, that they are requesting sensitive data that is not related to their job function, or they are using unauthorized storage devices.</p><p>Behavioral indicators you should look out for include finding someone who is attempting to bypass security, is frequently in the office at strange times, is constantly violating company policies, or is talking about resignation.</p><p>It is important to note that these things are not in themselves a sure sign that someone is an insider threat, but a combination of them may be enough to raise suspicion.</p><p>Additional Measures 03:10-03:51 In addition to employing data loss prevention software, there are other measures a company can take to protect itself. The security team should monitor employee activity, especially as it related to sensitive files. There should be a clear, secure place where sensitive files are kept, because it is harder to keep track of them if they are all over the place. Routinely review who has access to sensitive data to make sure that only those who need access have it. Using a &quot;least privilege model&quot; is a good idea as well. This means that each employee only has just enough privileges to do his or her job and nothing more. This helps keep employees from overstepping their boundaries.</p><p>Summary 03:51-04:33 Data loss prevention is a strategy that seeks to keep a company&#39;s sensitive data safe. These companies employ DLP software that prevents employees from taking certain actions that would compromise this data, such as sending emails to outside sources. Many data breaches are the result of insider threats, which are threats that come from within the company itself instead of from an outside hacker. There are both digital and behavioral clues that you can look for to determine whether someone might be an insider threat. In addition to using DLP software, companies can also institute policies that will help keep data safe, such as employing the least privilege model with their employees.</p><h3 id="_4-4-2-data-loss-prevention-dlp-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-4-2-data-loss-prevention-dlp-facts"><span>4.4.2 Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Facts</span></a></h3><p>This lesson covers the following topics:</p><ul><li>Data loss prevention (DLP) software</li><li>Insider threats</li><li>Common indicators</li><li>Additional measures</li></ul><h4 id="data-loss-prevention-dlp-software" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#data-loss-prevention-dlp-software"><span>Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Software</span></a></h4><p>To apply data guardianship policies and procedures, smaller organizations might classify and type data manually. However, an organization that creates and collects large amounts of personal data will usually need to use automated tools to assist with this task. There may also be a requirement to protect valuable intellectual property data. Data loss prevention (DLP) products automate the discovery and classification of data types and enforce rules so that data is not viewed or transferred without a proper authorization. Such solutions will usually consist of the following components:</p><ul><li><strong>Policy Server</strong> —To configure classification, confidentiality, privacy rules and policies, and to log incidents and compile reports.</li><li><strong>Endpoint Agents</strong> —To enforce policy on client computers, even when they are not connected to the network.</li><li><strong>Network Agents</strong> —To scan communications at network borders and interface with web and messaging servers to enforce policy.</li></ul><p>DLP agents scan content in structured formats, such as a database with a formal access control model or unstructured formats, such as email or word processing documents. A file-cracking process is applied to unstructured data to render it in a consistent scannable format. The transfer of content to removable media, such as USB devices, or by email, instant messaging, or social media, can then be blocked if it does not conform to a predefined policy. Most DLP solutions can extend the protection mechanisms to cloud storage services, using either a proxy to mediate access or the cloud service provider&#39;s API to perform scanning and policy enforcement.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="Steps to create a D L P policy in office 365."></p><blockquote><p>Description</p><p>Creating a DLP policy in Office 365.

There are many ways a security team can tell that something&#39;s suspicious or just flat out wrong. Data monitoring is an integral part of any organization&#39;s security strategy. Things move quickly in computing; organizations can&#39;t afford to let their guard down, even for a short time. In this video, we&#39;ll go over several tools security teams can use to spot potential threats.</p><p>Heuristic Analysis 00:30-01:09 One method is heuristic analysis. &quot;Heuristic&quot; comes from the ancient Greek word that means &quot;to discover.&quot; In this case, we&#39;re hoping to discover viruses or other malware. This kind of analysis uses software to search for specific commands or instructions that wouldn&#39;t normally be found in an application. If a program discovers a foreign command, it&#39;s likely discovered something that shouldn&#39;t be there, like a worm, Trojan, or virus. The software might take action, depending on how dangerous the foreign file appears. This could range from simply notifying the network administrator to automatically quarantining the file so that it doesn&#39;t affect the rest of the system.</p><p>Heuristic Programs 01:09-01:36 Heuristic programs typically take one of three approaches. First, they can analyze the files themselves to try to determine what a certain file&#39;s purpose is. If the file appears to have a malicious purpose, the program acts immediately. Second, they can emulate a file by bringing it into a virtual testing environment and running it. Finally, they can use genetic signature detection to try to spot files that look similar to previously known malware.</p><p>Data Trends 01:36-02:17 Security teams can also look for data trends. If we know what data is supposed to look like, we can more easily spot things that break the mold. Something that breaks a trend is called an outlier. Outliers could be flukes, or they could indicate something malicious. For this reason, a security team should always keep a close eye on any outliers.</p><p>For example, your security team might monitor the amount of data downloaded from a database in a typical workday. If the amount of data is many times the normal amount, this could signal that someone is trying to steal information from the database. Your security team would need to determine which user downloaded the extra data and whether they had a legitimate reason.</p><p>File Monitoring 02:17-02:50 A security team can also monitor activity in an organization&#39;s file system with software that notifies them of changes made to sensitive files. Keeping a user log also helps to keep track of everyone who handled data, should an investigation become necessary. You can monitor employees&#39; network activity to look for anything out of the ordinary. There&#39;s also software that validates an operating system&#39;s integrity and the applications that run on it by comparing the current file state to a known baseline. You can schedule monitoring at random or in real time.</p><p>Summary 02:50-03:18 That&#39;s it for this lesson. To recap, there are many tools that a security team can use to look for potential network threats. Heuristics uses software to search for specific commands that could indicate malware. Trend analysis looks for outliers in a data set. You can monitor an organization&#39;s file systems and networks to spot problems and look for clues about malicious events that have already occurred.</p><h3 id="_4-4-4-data-monitoring-methods-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-4-4-data-monitoring-methods-facts"><span>4.4.4 Data Monitoring Methods Facts</span></a></h3><p>Data monitoring is an integral part of any organization’s security strategy.</p><p>This lesson covers the following topics:</p><ul><li>File monitoring</li><li>Heuristics</li><li>Trend analysis</li></ul><h4 id="file-monitoring" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#file-monitoring"><span>File Monitoring</span></a></h4><p>File monitoring is the process of tracking changes to files.

PKI offers the opportunity to centralize digital certificate standards and the methods used to provide cryptographic services. This is important as it helps improve compliance with established policy and/or regulatory requirements relative to cryptography.</p><p>PKI provides the mechanisms required to confidently identify the owners of public keys. It issues digital certificates guaranteed by a trusted certificate authority (CA). Trusted CAs are pre-established by recording their information within operating system certificate stores or browsers and by using special hardware storage components. Digital certificates are foundational to HTTPS traffic.</p><h4 id="secure-sockets-layer-ssl-inspection" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#secure-sockets-layer-ssl-inspection"><span>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Inspection</span></a></h4><p>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) inspection is the process of inspecting encrypted HTTPS traffic. Without SSL inspection, network administrators can&#39;t monitor encrypted traffic for threats, making HTTPS traffic an easy method for attackers to avoid detection. SSL inspection is also essential for verifying that website certificates are valid, helping protect against on-path attacks (where an attacker intercepts communications between two parties) and detecting traffic encrypted with anything other than a trusted third-party certificate. This also helps enforce organizational rules, ensuring that employees comply with Acceptable Use Policies and do not attempt to access restricted content or share restricted data.</p><p>SSL inspection is often accomplished by installing digital certificates on end devices that allow encrypted traffic to be intercepted, decrypted, and inspected by security tools or software before being re-encrypted and forwarded to the intended destination. Web proxies, load balancers, next-gen firewalls, and similar devices all support this capability.</p>',9)]))}const h=n(l,[["render",c],["__file","4.4.html.vue"]]),p=JSON.parse('{"path":"/CyberDefensePro/4.4.html","title":"4.4 Data Protection","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{"lang":"zh-CN","title":"4.4 Data Protection","description":"some description"},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Section 4.4 Data Protection","slug":"section-4-4-data-protection","link":"#section-4-4-data-protection","children":[{"level":3,"title":"4.4.1 Data Loss Prevention (DLP)","slug":"_4-4-1-data-loss-prevention-dlp","link":"#_4-4-1-data-loss-prevention-dlp","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"4.4.2 Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Facts","slug":"_4-4-2-data-loss-prevention-dlp-facts","link":"#_4-4-2-data-loss-prevention-dlp-facts","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"4.4.3 Data Monitoring Methods","slug":"_4-4-3-data-monitoring-methods","link":"#_4-4-3-data-monitoring-methods","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"4.4.4 Data Monitoring Methods Facts","slug":"_4-4-4-data-monitoring-methods-facts","link":"#_4-4-4-data-monitoring-methods-facts","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"4.4.5 Risk Identification Process Facts","slug":"_4-4-5-risk-identification-process-facts","link":"#_4-4-5-risk-identification-process-facts","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"4.4.6 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)","slug":"_4-4-6-public-key-infrastructure-pki","link":"#_4-4-6-public-key-infrastructure-pki","children":[]}]}],"git":{"updatedTime":1746415970000},"filePathRelative":"CyberDefensePro/4.4.md"}');export{h as comp,p as data};
