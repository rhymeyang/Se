Analysis activities in the context of cybersecurity engineering identify and explore potential actions performed by abstract adversarial actors with malicious intent and the damage that can arise from the compromise of cybersecurity of the vehicle E/E systems. Coordination between cybersecurity engineering and expertise from other disciplines can support the in-depth analysis and mitigation of specific cybersecurity risks (cf. ISO/TR 4804 [6]). Cybersecurity monitoring, remediation and incident response activities complement concept and product development activities as a reactive approach acknowledging the changing conditions in the environment (e.g. new attack technologies) and the ongoing need to identify and manage weaknesses and vulnerabilities in road vehicle E/E systems.</p><p>A defence-in-depth approach can be used to mitigate cybersecurity risk. The defence-in-depth approach utilizes layers of cybersecurity controls to improve the cybersecurity of the vehicle.
