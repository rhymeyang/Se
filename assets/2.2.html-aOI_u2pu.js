How are you doing, Ian? I&#39;m doing great, James. Thanks for having me on this. Ian&#39;s going to talk to us a little bit</p><p>about his history and then talk about</p><p>what it means to apply the appropriate risk strategies.</p><p>Tell us about yourself and let&#39;s start talking</p><p>about some risky business here. All right, sounds good. I&#39;m the CISO for Cyjax, a threat intelligence company and I,</p><p>one of the trends that I&#39;m sort of tracking and looking at</p><p>is the growing importance of GRC in driving businesses decisions and in order to do that, they have to have the kind of information,</p><p>the kind of strategic information,</p><p>to make those decisions. You know, as you&#39;re sourcing whether it be external developers, internal developers</p><p>or you&#39;re procuring something from some sort of provider,</p><p>what are some of those risk assessment factors</p><p>that you look into? I think a lot of us have heard of whether it be MTTR or MTBF and et al.,</p><p>how do all of those things work together</p><p>to determine your risk assessment?</p><p>Yeah. So, I mean, what you&#39;re talking about is sort of the more,</p><p>the operational risk of this new thing</p><p>we&#39;re going to bring into existence</p><p>and I mean, it&#39;s one thing to put it on a piece of paper,</p><p>it&#39;s quite another thing to actually practice it,</p><p>you know, in a lot of cases, GRC is going to suggest</p><p>what they can live with, what their tolerance is</p><p>for downtime and they&#39;re going to pass that requirement</p><p>on to the procurement or to the project manager</p><p>in charge of bringing this new thing to life.</p><p>But I think where the focus now of GRC is really</p><p>around what kind of data do we have,</p><p>what kind of policies do we have in place to govern that particular type of data,</p><p>be it a data retention policy or be it all data must be encrypted at rest</p><p>and in transit and then finally, and this is sort of the new huge issue on the block</p><p>that GRC is facing, is geography.</p><p>We want to live in this global marketplace,</p><p>the reality is there are some countries that are</p><p>very sensitive about data, where it is, who&#39;s processing it,</p><p>who&#39;s prying eyes are looking at it.</p><p>And then, you know, the aspirations of a sales</p><p>and marketing team about doing business in new territories,</p><p>really has to go through a lens of GRC informing them</p><p>that the best approach would be to get a partner</p><p>on the ground because, you know, setting up</p><p>a corporate entity there might be difficult,</p><p>in the case of Latin America, the Middle East,</p><p>that&#39;s truly the thing or it might be impossible</p><p>to do without a partner on the ground</p><p>in some other countries. You know, it&#39;s interesting to see too where,</p><p>a lot of times, people talk about the risk of data loss</p><p>and that&#39;s, that&#39;s right, but so often there are</p><p>regulations that will say, &quot;Well, X company,</p><p>if you&#39;re going to go into business</p><p>in this particular region, you have to make sure that data is available to the customers</p><p>and if it&#39;s not, there are fines and things like that too,&quot; right?</p><p>I&#39;ve seen that. When it comes to handling risk,</p><p>you can transfer, you know, have the insurance company pick it up, yeah, right.</p><p>You can accept the risk and avoid it.</p><p>Let&#39;s talk about, you know, mitigation,</p><p>all those different elements of risk handling.</p><p>Yeah. So, first and foremost, GRC really needs to be</p><p>at the front of the, of the line when it comes to this</p><p>because they need to make sure everybody around the table</p><p>understands, you know, what the protections of that data need to be</p><p>from a policy perspective, from a regulatory compliance perspective.</p><p>That should drive all the discussion amongst,</p><p>you know, all of the delivery efforts so the IT department,</p><p>the development department, security, all of them</p><p>need to understand what it is that&#39;s being built,</p><p>what the level of risk to the business is</p><p>and then it&#39;s time to whiteboard and they&#39;ll get creative solutions for dealing with this.</p><p>Now, it&#39;s going to cost money, that&#39;s the thing.</p><p>So, if you never had static testing</p><p>or dynamic testing of code, but the data</p><p>that you&#39;re dealing with is sensitive enough</p><p>to warrant that you need all, to take all of these precautions,</p><p>then, you know, that&#39;s something that needs to be tabled</p><p>in the risk, it&#39;s going to affect the budget,</p><p>it might even protect, it might even impact</p><p>the delivery time for the project.</p><p>IT security has to be at the table</p><p>and voice their wisdom on saying,</p><p>&quot;Hey, do not worry, we got this. We have similar applications with similar providers</p><p>and this is the de rigueur that we&#39;ve put them through,</p><p>this is the telemetry that we&#39;re getting</p><p>to throw into our SIM, you know, we got you.&quot;</p><p>And then, you know, everyone else</p><p>can breathe a sigh of relief because, you know,</p><p>IT security are the big heroes in this story.</p><p>Absolutely. When it comes to tracking risk,</p><p>there are risk registers for example,</p><p>let&#39;s talk about what a risk register is</p><p>and then some of the key performance indicators</p><p>of what it means to track risk. Yeah, and, you know, I will say that GRC&#39;s role</p><p>has gotten really difficult because so much risk now</p><p>in business is dynamic and a lot of that dynamic risk</p><p>is dependent on your hosting provider</p><p>or the line of business vendor of the particular thing</p><p>because when you think of it, almost every company out there</p><p>is a franking company, you know, they&#39;re taking a piece of Oracle and a piece of Azure</p><p>and a piece of Google and they&#39;re throwing it together</p><p>and they&#39;re building their thing that makes them money</p><p>or they&#39;re providing their service</p><p>that think makes money. So, the GRC&#39;s role now I think is really focused on</p><p>supply chain issues and compliance within that supply chain</p><p>and trying to, you know, educate procurement teams and,</p><p>and project management in, you know,</p><p>what is the sort of minimum threshold</p><p>that will engage with the company.</p><p>You know, what is the level of risk tolerance</p><p>that we have in this organization.</p><p>Because nobody wants to buy something</p><p>that becomes the next big hack, right?</p><p>That&#39;s usually a career ending decision when that happens.</p><p>And I think, GRC&#39;s role now is to really articulate</p><p>on that tolerance of risk and when they work</p><p>in conjunction with IT audit, you have a very powerful story about due diligence</p><p>within an organization and that due diligence,</p><p>if the worst happens, is going to be the thing</p><p>that saves the company from heavy regulatory fines and penalties.</p><p>I like to say, in cyber security,</p><p>you can try and fail, that&#39;s okay so long as you have evidence that you tried.</p><p>[James] That&#39;s right. [Ian] If you don&#39;t try and you fail,</p><p>bad things are coming for you.

Risk management helps to minimize an organization&#39;s exposure to cyber threats. It also helps organizations comply with data security and privacy regulations and standards. Risk management helps to ensure that organizational assets are well-protected.</p><p>People are one of the most important assets to an organization. Skilled and engaged employees can drive innovation, productivity, and overall business success. Customers provide a source of revenue and valuable feedback that can be used to improve products and services and drive future growth.</p><p>Computer and network systems are other valuable resources to an organization, enabling efficient data management, business communication, and collaboration among employees. An organization&#39;s data hold private customer and organizational information. It also provides insights into customer behavior, operational efficiency, and market trends that drive business success. The security of customers and other confidential data is essential to any organization. And, of course, finances are an important asset. Finances, whether in cash or other investments, provide the foundation for current and future operations.</p><p>Risk Identification 01:17-02:27 One of the first steps of risk management is to identify potential risks. Risks can come from various sources, including natural disasters, cyberattacks, human error, and noncompliance with regulatory compliance requirements. An organization&#39;s finances, operations, network infrastructure, and reputation can be at risk.</p><p>When identifying risk, it&#39;s also important to consider the potential repercussions associated with each. Financial repercussions associated with cybersecurity can include stolen funds, lost sales, recovery costs, and regulatory fines or legal costs.</p><p>System downtime or disruption, loss of critical data or intellectual property, and compromised or damaged organizational assets and operations are examples of operational risks associated with cybersecurity threats.</p><p>Cybersecurity incidents or perceived lack of security measures can result in reputational risks. These could include public exposure of sensitive or confidential data, negative media coverage, social media backlash, and loss of customer trust. Considering the potential repercussions of a risk helps prepare you to assign a response to each.</p><p>Risk Response Strategies 02:27-03:25 The next steps of risk management involve evaluating the nature and repercussions of each risk to determine its severity. Once calculated, the severity is then used to determine which response strategy should be applied.</p><p>There are four types of risk responses. Risk avoidance involves eliminating or not engaging in activities that pose a potential cyber risk, such as not allowing employees to use personal devices for work-related activities. Risk mitigation involves reducing the likelihood or impact of a cyber threat through proactive measures, such as implementing firewalls and intrusion detection systems.</p><p>Risk acceptance involves acknowledging and accepting the potential risk, such as not implementing additional security measures despite being aware of potential vulnerabilities. Risk transfer involves transferring the risk to another party, such as purchasing cybersecurity insurance to help mitigate financial loss resulting from a cyber attack.</p><p>Risk Monitoring 03:25-03:56 Finally, it&#39;s necessary for cybersecurity organizations to continuously monitor and evaluate potential risks and the effectiveness of their risk response strategies. This involves conducting regular risk assessments, testing security controls, and updating policies and procedures based on changes in the threat landscape or organizational needs. By staying vigilant and adaptable, cybersecurity organizations can be well-prepared to address potential risks and protect their assets from cyber threats and attacks.</p><p>Summary 03:56-04:13 That&#39;s it for this lesson. In this lesson, we discussed risk management. We talked about identifying financial, operational, and reputational risks. We examined risk response strategies. We also discussed the importance of ongoing monitoring and evaluating potential risks.</p><h3 id="_2-2-3-threat-modeling" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-2-3-threat-modeling"><span>2.2.3 Threat Modeling</span></a></h3><p>Click one of the buttons to take you to that part of the video.</p><p>Threat Modeling 00:00-00:52 As a cybersecurity professional, you help to protect your company&#39;s assets and data. One of the best ways to do this is through threat modeling.</p><p>Threat modeling is a risk management process that helps identify, quantify, and prioritize potential threats to your business. It&#39;s used to evaluate and minimize the risk of a data breach or other malicious activity.</p><p>To start, you should analyze your company&#39;s assets and data to determine which ones are most important and vulnerable. Then, you can create a list of potential threats, such as a malicious hacker, natural disaster, or cyber-attack. Once you&#39;ve identified the threats, you can create a plan of action to mitigate the risks. This may include implementing security measures such as firewalls and user authentication or increasing your data backup. By taking the time to analyze and address potential threats properly, you can ensure that your company&#39;s assets and data remain secure and protected.</p><p>5 Steps of Threat Modeling 00:52-03:06 Now that we&#39;ve talked about the basics of threat modeling let&#39;s look at the five steps involved.</p><p>The first step is adversary capability analysis. This involves understanding the capabilities of potential attackers so you can assess the risks they pose to your company. During this phase, you&#39;ll identify potential threat sources, determine how likely those attacks will occur, and consider what the adversary is capable of. For example: What damage could they do or what data could be accessed?</p><p>The second step is total attack surface analysis. This is a process of evaluating the entire attack surface of your assets to identify all the ways an adversary could access the system. When determining the total attack surface, it&#39;s critical to consider any possible entry points, such as external networks or internal applications. During this step, you&#39;ll also want to take inventory of the entire network. The inventory should include hardware, software, and the capabilities and processes of each device.</p><p>The third step is attack vector analysis. This involves analyzing the different methods attackers may use to gain access to your data, such as malware, phishing scams, or social engineering. An attack vector is a specific path or means by which an attacker can gain access to a system or data. There are three main categories of attack vectors. Cyber-attack vectors involve hardware or software being used for an attack. Human attackers use social engineering techniques such as impersonating or coercing an employee inside the organization. Physical attack vectors involve attackers with malicious intent gaining physical access to the target location.</p><p>The fourth step is impact analysis. This step helps you to understand the potential impacts of a breach or attack. The impact could include system repairs, fines, contract penalties, and lost customers. It could also impact your organization&#39;s reputation and customer confidence and satisfaction.</p><p>The fifth and final step is likelihood analysis. This involves assessing the likelihood of a particular attack occurring based on the information from the previous four steps. When considering the likelihood of a threat, you&#39;ll want to consider an attacker&#39;s motivation, emerging capabilities, the effectiveness of attacks, and the annual rate of occurrence. These considerations help you decide what chance there is of an attack happening.</p><p>Summary 03:06-03:21 That&#39;s it for this lesson. In this lesson, we discussed threat modeling and the five steps involved—adversary capability analysis, total attack surface analysis, attack vector analysis, impact analysis, and likelihood analysis.</p><h3 id="_2-2-4-threat-modeling-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-2-4-threat-modeling-facts"><span>2.2.4 Threat Modeling Facts</span></a></h3><p>This lesson covers the following topics:</p><ul><li>Threat modeling</li><li>The five steps of threat modeling</li></ul><h4 id="threat-modeling" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#threat-modeling"><span>Threat Modeling</span></a></h4><p>Threat modeling is designed to identify the principal risks and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that a system may be subject to by evaluating the system both from an attacker&#39;s point of view and the defender&#39;s point of view. For each scenario-based threat situation, the model asks whether defensive systems are sufficient to repel an attack perpetrated by an adversary with a given level of capability. Threat modeling can be used to assess risks against corporate networks and business systems, and it can also be performed against more specific targets, such as a website or software deployment. The outputs from threat modeling can be used to build use cases for security monitoring and detection systems. Threat modeling is typically a collaborative process with inputs from various stakeholders. In addition to cybersecurity experts with knowledge of the relevant threat intelligence and research, stakeholders can include non-experts, such as users and customers, and persons with different priorities on the technical side, such as those who represent financial, marketing, and legal concerns.</p><h4 id="the-five-steps-of-threat-modeling" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-five-steps-of-threat-modeling"><span>The Five Steps of Threat Modeling</span></a></h4><p>There are five basic threat modeling steps.</p><h5 id="adversary-capability-analysis" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#adversary-capability-analysis"><span>Adversary Capability Analysis</span></a></h5><p>During the adversary capability analysis step, identify potential threat sources, determine how likely these attacks are, and consider the adversary&#39;s capabilities.
