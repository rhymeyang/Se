Just like regular mail, email can contain wonderful things, like a letter from a friend or family member. But it can also contain harmful things, like a mail bomb or its digital equivalent. Knowing what to look for when you analyze emails can help you stay safe as you communicate electronically with others. In this video, I&#39;ll go over how you can make sure your email communication stays as secure as possible.</p><p>Malicious Payload 00:33-01:26 Let&#39;s look at an analogy. If someone fires a missile, the payload is the part that blows up, causing the destruction. The same is true when talking about email. The payload is the part of a malicious email that causes damage when opened. With a missile, it&#39;s possible that the payload sits harmlessly on the ground until it&#39;s disarmed or until something else comes along to make it explode.</p><p>With a malicious email, though, the payload can lay dormant for a long time. A payload could be something that&#39;s attached to the email, or it could be associated with a link in the email as well. For example, things like viruses, worms, and Trojans could all be malicious payloads. It&#39;s basically anything that can cause harm to the recipient. The sender can do a variety of things once a payload is activated, like steal data, display unwanted ads, modify user files, download harmful new files, or run malicious background processes.</p><p>DKIM 01:26-01:50 DomainKeys Identified Mail, or DKIM, is often used to authenticate emails in an effort to mitigate harm. DKIM lets an email&#39;s recipient verify that the email was sent by the domain owner. This is possible because emails have a sort of encrypted digital signature. The encryption is taken care of on the server side, so it&#39;s not something an end user can usually see.</p><p>SPF 01:50-02:14 Spam emails often carry malicious messages that can make your organization look bad if people see that the emails are coming from your domain. Sender Policy Framework, or SPF, is another email authentication method that helps weed out attackers who want to send out spam emails under someone else&#39;s name. This program lets you specify which email servers are allowed to send out email under your domain and which aren&#39;t.</p><p>DMARC 02:14-02:53 Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance, or DMARC, is another kind of email authentication and reporting policy. It builds on the security that&#39;s provided by DKIM and SPF. DMARC lets the sender inform the recipient that their emails are protected by DKIM and SPF and tells them what to do if an email doesn&#39;t pass these security checks. The response is usually to delete the message or to automatically put it in the junk folder. DMARC also allows the recipient to report back to the sender about which emails failed the security measures. This helps isolate end users from potential attacks.</p><p>Phishing 02:53-03:54 Phishing is a digital crime in which a criminal contacts someone through email pretending to be from a legitimate organization. For example, an attacker might claim to be from your bank or from a well-known website, such as Netflix or Amazon, telling you that your account has been locked and that they need certain information to unlock it. Often, they use official company logos and graphics to make their email look legitimate.</p><p>Attackers use this official-looking email to try to lure the recipient into giving them personal information or clicking on a malicious link embedded in the email itself. In essence, they&#39;re fishing for information and the email is the bait. If the recipient sends the requested information or clicks on the link, he or she could have their identity stolen or their account hacked. To avoid falling prey to a phishing scam, it&#39;s a good idea to not click on links in emails unless you&#39;re sure you know the sender. Often, we see typos in these kinds of emails or slight misspellings of company names, such as amazun.com instead of amazon.com.</p><p>Forwarding 03:54-04:34 Forwarding an email simply means that you send an entire email that you&#39;ve received to another person. If you forward an email that has a malicious payload, it can potentially damage anyone who receives it. Sometimes, emails specifically ask you to forward them on to other friends, which should be an immediate red flag.</p><p>Some people also set up automatic email forwarding from multiple accounts to a single account. While this isn&#39;t necessarily a security risk, it can open you up to problems if you send emails from a more secure account to a less secure one. You want to make sure that emails with sensitive information, like work emails, don&#39;t get forwarded to a service that&#39;s vulnerable to being hacked.</p><p>Email Parts 04:34-05:14 To fully analyze an email, an investigator needs to look at all of its parts.</p><p>Many emails contain a block signature at the bottom that shows the user&#39;s information, such as phone number, address, or company position. These things are often added automatically, so this becomes an important part of tracking where an email is coming from.</p><p>Another part of an email that contains a great deal of information is the header. This is a block of information at the top that&#39;s usually hidden from the recipient and includes things like the recipient&#39;s name, send date, timestamps, and the names of the servers that handled the transfer. This data can be vitally important to your investigation of a potentially malicious email.</p><p>Summary 05:14-06:11 That&#39;s it for this lesson. In this lesson, we went over email analysis as an important forensic tool to combat digital crimes, and we looked at some ways in which these crimes are committed. Some emails contain a malicious payload, like a virus or other malware, that can harm the recipient&#39;s computer. We have several methods to prevent this, such as DKIM, SPF, and DMARC.</p><p>Both headers and signatures are important parts of an email that we can gather information from. Phishing is another kind of email attack in which a criminal pretends to be someone else, usually someone from a trusted company, to try to steal personal information. Often, those who send malicious emails encourage the recipient to forward them to other friends in an effort to spread the damage even farther. It&#39;s important that you, as a security analyst, be aware of all the ways in which emails can be compromised so you can prevent any potential attacks.</p><h3 id="_6-8-2-email-analysis-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-8-2-email-analysis-facts"><span>6.8.2 Email Analysis Facts</span></a></h3><p>There are several aspects of email analysis to consider in digital forensics.</p><p>This lesson covers the following topics:</p><ul><li>Parts of an email</li><li>Malicious payload</li><li>Email authentication tools</li><li>Phishing</li><li>Forwarding</li></ul><h4 id="parts-of-an-email" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#parts-of-an-email"><span>Parts of an Email</span></a></h4><p>Understanding the parts of an email is the beginning of the analysis.</p><ul><li>Email headers are: <ul><li>Code at the beginning of an email that contains such things as: <ul><li>Recipient&#39;s name.</li><li>Send date.</li><li>Timestamps.</li><li>Names of servers that handled the transfer.</li></ul></li><li>Typically hidden from the reader&#39;s view at the top of the page.</li></ul></li><li>Block signatures: <ul><li>Contain helpful information about the sender, such as: <ul><li>Name.</li><li>Company position.</li><li>Address.</li><li>Phone number.</li></ul></li><li>Are often automatically included at the end of an email.</li></ul></li></ul><h4 id="malicious-payload" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#malicious-payload"><span>Malicious Payload</span></a></h4><p>In cyber interactions and communications, a malicious payload can take many forms.

When an email is created, the mail user agent (MUA) creates an initial header and forwards the message to a mail delivery agent (MDA).</p><p>The MDA should check that the sender is authorized to issue messages from the domain. Assuming the email is not being delivered locally at the same domain, the MDA adds or amends its own header and then transmits the message to a message transfer agent (MTA). The MTA routes the message to the recipient, using DNS to locate the recipient&#39;s MTA, with the message passing via one or more additional MTAs, such as SMTP servers operated by ISPs or mail security gateways.

You can view and copy headers from a mail client via a message properties/options/source command. MTAs can add a lot of information in each received header, such as the results of spam checking. If you use a plain text editor to view the header, it can be difficult to identify where each part begins and ends. Fortunately, plenty of tools are available to parse headers and display them in a more structured format. One example is the Message Analyzer tool, available as part of the Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer ( <a href="https://cdn.testout.com/cyberdefensepro2023v2-en-us/en-us/resources/text/t_email_header_cdp2/testconnectivity.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">testconnectivity.microsoft.com</a> ).
