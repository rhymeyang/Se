A threat actor is a person or organization that threatens another person&#39;s or organization&#39;s security.</p><p>Hacker Types 00:13-00:28 Let&#39;s break down the threat actor types even more by looking at their motivations. Hackers almost always have unethical, malicious intentions. Some hackers are motivated by religious or political beliefs. Others are motivated by greed, blackmail, or revenge.</p><p>Hacktivist 00:28-00:43 A hacktivist often targets government agencies or corporations to protest their actions. Hacktivists are most known for defacing websites and executing denial-of-service attacks. Their main purpose is to protest and campaign for public attention.</p><p>Nation-State Hacker 00:43-01:04 A nation state hacker works for a government and attempts to gain top-secret information by hacking other governments&#39; devices. Many nations have invested in the development of their cybersecurity presence and are willing to use this presence to reach their political or economic goals. Election systems, energy grids, intelligence agencies, and other critical systems are common targets.</p><p>Criminal Organizations 01:04-01:32 Criminal organizations have also transitioned much of their operations to the virtual setting. The internet provides a wider range of targets and provides additional options for covering their tracks. Because criminals are often targeting individuals in different jurisdictions, prosecution can be very difficult.</p><p>A threat actor doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be an outside hacker. They could be an internal threat, or even someone who causes a security vulnerability through negligence.</p><p>Internal Threats 01:32-02:20 Intentional internal threats could include employees, vendors, or contractors that use their network access to access confidential information or to hinder the availability of data or systems. The motivations for these insiders could include competitiveness, greed, or grievances against the organization. They could be acting on their own accord, or they could be recruited by an outsider.</p><p>Unintentional threats are usually a result of a lack of training or laziness. Although they don&#39;t intend to cause harm, their actions could result in unintentional weakened security points that could be used by external attackers. The best network security systems can be rendered practically useless if employees don&#39;t know how to use them effectively. Security training is critical for employees at all levels of an organization.</p><p>Summary 02:20-02:35 That&#39;s it for this lesson. In this video, we discussed threat actor types. such as hacktivists, nation state hackers, criminal organizations, and internal threats.</p><h3 id="_3-1-2-threat-actor-type-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-1-2-threat-actor-type-facts"><span>3.1.2 Threat Actor Type Facts</span></a></h3><p>This lesson covers threat actors.</p><h4 id="threat-actors" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#threat-actors"><span>Threat Actors</span></a></h4><p>Threat actors are individuals or groups who exploit network or system vulnerabilities.
