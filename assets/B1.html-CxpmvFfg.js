As you work through the course, follow these hints for effective study: <ul><li> Review the learning and exam objectives on each section page. The objectives outline the knowledge and skills you will need for the official certification exam. </li><li>Watch the videos.</li><li>Watch the demonstrations.</li><li>Read all text lesson fact pages.</li><li> Practice the tasks in the lab simulations until you feel comfortable with your ability to complete them. </li><li> Avoid skipping any sections unless you can easily pass the Practice Questions at the end of each section. Even if you already know the material, a review can always be helpful when preparing for an exam. </li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Review the certification exam domains and objectives</td><td> Review the domains and objectives for the TestOut CyberDefense Pro Certification provided in this section. </td></tr><tr><td>Take the domain practice exams</td><td> The domain practice exams group the performance-based labs by domain and helps assess your understanding of a particular TestOut CyberDefense Pro Certification domain and the corresponding objectives. </td></tr><tr><td>Take the certification practice exam</td><td> After you are confident with your ability to complete the labs, take the certification practice exam to assess your preparedness to take the certification exam. <ul><li> This exam has roughly the same number of questions and time limit as the TestOut CyberDefense Pro Certification. </li><li> Practice questions are designed to assess your knowledge as it relates to the exam objectives. </li><li> Based on your practice exam results, review the course material for questions that you missed. </li><li> Focus your time on understanding the topics covered in the objectives and not on memorizing answers, as the actual certification exam will have a different set of questions. </li><li> When your practice exam scores are consistently over 95%, and you feel confident in your understanding of the exam objectives and topics, the next step is to take the certification exam. </li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Schedule and take the certification exam</td><td> The TestOut CyberDefense Pro Certification is scheduled through LabSim.
