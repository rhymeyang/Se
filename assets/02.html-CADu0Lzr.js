The automotive industry has come a long way from the birth of this industry in the late 18th century and this is made clear in this chapter by describing the history and the evolution of the earliest automobiles. This chapter then goes on to include the basic automotive terminology used in the traditional automotive ecosystem. It then continues to detail the transformation taking place in the automotive sector and enumerates the new autonomous terminology being utilized in the Connected &amp; Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) eco-system. Finally, this chapter introduces the reader to the emerging area of smartcities and the cybersecurity challenges that will have to be overcome due to this shift in mobility.</p><h2 id="history-of-the-automobile" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#history-of-the-automobile"><span>History of the Automobile</span></a></h2><p>The earliest “automobiles” were developed in the late 18th century. These were steam-powered, self-propelled vehicles large enough to transport people and cargo. A Frenchman by the name of Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot demonstrated his fardier à vapeur (&quot;steam dray&quot;) in 1770 and 1771. This was an experimental steam-driven artillery tractor and proved to have had an unfeasible design. Later, in 1784, William Murdoch, a British Engineer, built a working model of a steam carriage in Redruth and in 1801, another Brit, Richard Trevithick was running a full-sized vehicle on the roads in Camborne. Also, in 1789, the first automobile patent in the United States was granted to Oliver Evans.</p><p>Figure 2: Cugnot&#39;s steam wagon, the second (1771) version During the early 1800s, there were plenty of innovations to improve the design of the steam-powered vehicles. These included hand brakes, multi-speed transmissions, and better steering. Further efforts to develop more usable vehicles were made throughout the century and by 1867, a Canadian jeweller named Henry Seth Taylor had demonstrated his 4-wheeled “steam buggy” at the Stanstead Fair in Stanstead, Quebec. This was succeeded by the development of the first &quot;real&quot; automobile, which was produced in 1873 by Frenchman Amédée Bollée in Le Mans. This vehicle was a self-propelled steam road vehicle to transport groups of passengers and was a major step forward in the development of the automotive industry.</p><h2 id="basic-automotive-terminology" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#basic-automotive-terminology"><span>Basic Automotive Terminology</span></a></h2><p>In this section, some basic explanations, and definitions of the most fundamental automotive technology are detailed.</p><h2 id="internal-combustion-engine" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#internal-combustion-engine"><span>Internal Combustion Engine</span></a></h2><p>Although, the early road vehicles used steam-powered vehicles, the Internal Combustion Engine or ICE is used in most automobiles on the road today.

The primary reason for this evolution is the human desire to always stay connected and the catalyst for this evolution are new and exciting technologies that can enable this connectivity. Innovation has also ensured that there are immense synergies in the &quot;Vehicle of the Future&quot; for both the Automotive and Information Technology industries. Examples of these innovations include the environmentally friendly electric vehicles (EVs) and V2X (Vehicle to Everything) connectivity for enabling communications outside the vehicle. Other innovations are happening daily as automotive technology is used to solve new challenges for the Automotive sector. This means that the field of Automotive Technology is projected to grow exponentially for the foreseeable future and ensure that self-driving autonomous vehicles (AVs) develop into more efficient and safer forms of transportation.</p><h2 id="automotive-technology-history" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#automotive-technology-history"><span>Automotive Technology History</span></a></h2><p>Since the Internal Combustion Engine was invented in the 1800&#39;s, the automotive industry was perceived to be related to the field of Mechanical Engineering. Building a vehicle was always about steel and plastic. In contrast, the technology industry has always been all about computers &amp; lines of software code and has proliferated into our daily lives from cell phones to ATMs. This proliferation of technology into society has also slowly but steadily entered the automotive sector. Some examples of this technology enablement in vehicles are apps for navigation based on global positioning systems (GPS) and software that enables better design of vehicles. However, there was slow acceptance of this technological evolution from the consumers. Thus, only recently consumers have become accepting of the integration of technology into their everyday vehicle.</p><h2 id="mobility-s-new-frontiers-case" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#mobility-s-new-frontiers-case"><span>Mobility&#39;s new frontiers: CASE</span></a></h2><p>Today, we are living through a time when Mobility is undergoing one of the most transformational social, technological, and economic shifts of recent times.
