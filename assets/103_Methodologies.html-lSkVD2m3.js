Waterfall excels in structured, regulatory-heavy environments but lacks flexibility. Agile is dynamic and allows for quick adaptation to cybersecurity threats but may lack the control needed for complex compliance. Tailoring methodologies to specific project needs is critical, and hybrid models may offer the best of both worlds.</p>',39)]))}const c=i(o,[["render",n],["__file","103_Methodologies.html.vue"]]),d=JSON.parse('{"path":"/304/103_Methodologies.html","title":"Project Management Methodologies","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Agenda","slug":"agenda","link":"#agenda","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Key Points","slug":"key-points","link":"#key-points","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Project Lifecycle Phases","slug":"project-lifecycle-phases","link":"#project-lifecycle-phases","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Recap of Project Management","slug":"recap-of-project-management","link":"#recap-of-project-management","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Review of PMBOK and Agile","slug":"review-of-pmbok-and-agile","link":"#review-of-pmbok-and-agile","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Waterfall Methodology","slug":"waterfall-methodology","link":"#waterfall-methodology","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Agile Methodology","slug":"agile-methodology","link":"#agile-methodology","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Waterfall vs Agile","slug":"waterfall-vs-agile","link":"#waterfall-vs-agile","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Tailoring Methodologies","slug":"tailoring-methodologies","link":"#tailoring-methodologies","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Discussion","slug":"discussion","link":"#discussion","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Case Study","slug":"case-study","link":"#case-study","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Summary / Key Takeaways","slug":"summary-key-takeaways","link":"#summary-key-takeaways","children":[]}],"git":{"updatedTime":1728404776000,"contributors":[{"name":"rhyme_yang","email":"rhyme_yang@live.cn","commits":1}]},"filePathRelative":"304/103_Methodologies.md"}');export{c as comp,d as data};
