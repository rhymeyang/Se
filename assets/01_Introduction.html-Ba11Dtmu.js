Doctors provide direct guidance to nurses and other support staff. Decision-making is very hierarchical: what the senior managers decide is typically what will occur. However, the doctors are outspoken and will push back against decisions they believe will degrade patient care or diminish their authority with patient care or staff management.</p><p>The expectation of all hospital staff is that patient care comes first. Tat expectation can lead to financial pressures when the care provided will not be fully paid for by insurance companies. Pursuing patients for past due amounts is time-intensive and emotionally trying for the hospital&#39;s administrative staff.</p><p>Senior managers exhibit a &quot;silo mentality.&quot; They make decisions in the best interest of their responsibilities within the hospital, rarely conferring with their senior management peers. Dr. Olsen, the COO, will intervene and force the senior leaders to work together only when she believes significant benefits may result, or significant issues will arise from a lack of communication.</p><p>In general, hospital staff are cared for reasonably well. They are overworked, due to a deep-seated expectation that compassion be shown to patients. The hospital has a reputation for being friendly with patients and their families. Staff see the more demanding side of the hospital culture. However, in times of need or strife, hospital management will show significant compassion for their staff. Some say that compassions needs to be shown before staff get to the breaking point, but acknowledge it is provided abundantly when significant needs arise.</p><h4 id="brisland-hospital-organizational-structure" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#brisland-hospital-organizational-structure"><span>Brisland Hospital Organizational Structure</span></a></h4><p>Dr. Carla Olsen, as the project sponsor and the hospital&#39;s Chief Operating Officer(CEO), has significant authority and influence.</p><p>Dr. Olsen is very busy. She manages Physician and Patient Services. Hospital facilities are managed by Nicholas Anderson, the VP of General Services. The purchase and management of the hospital&#39;s technical equipment and staffing are managed by Marid Diaz, the Financial Controller. The VP and Financial Controller are Dr. Olsen&#39;s management peers (see the organization chart for Brisland Hospital).</p><p>第 1 章挑战</p><p><strong>布里斯兰医院组织文化</strong> 总结：“专制与同情”</p><p>布里斯兰医院的文化是专制的。 医生为护士和其他支持人员提供直接指导。 决策是非常分层的：高级管理人员的决定通常就是将要发生的事情。 然而，医生们是直言不讳的，他们认为会降低患者护理或削弱他们在患者护理或员工管理方面的权威的决定会予以抵制。</p><p>所有医院工作人员的期望是患者护理至上。 当保险公司无法全额支付所提供的护理费用时，这种期望可能会导致财务压力。 对于医院的管理人员来说，追查患者逾期未付的款项是一项耗时且费力的工作。</p><p>高级管理人员表现出“筒仓心态”。 他们根据医院职责的最佳利益做出决策，很少与高级管理人员协商。 首席运营官奥尔森博士只有在她认为可能会带来重大利益，或者由于缺乏沟通而出现重大问题时，才会进行干预并迫使高层领导共同努力。</p><p>总的来说，医院工作人员得到了相当好的照顾。 由于对病人表现出同情心的根深蒂固的期望，他们工作过度。 该医院以对患者及其家属友好而享有盛誉。 工作人员看到了医院文化中要求更高的一面。 然而，在需要或冲突的时候，医院管理层会对员工表现出极大的同情心。 有人说，在员工达到极限之前，需要表现出同情心，但也承认，当出现重大需求时，人们会充分提供同情心。</p><p>布里斯兰医院组织结构</p><p>Carla Olsen博士作为项目发起人和医院的首席运营官（CEO），拥有显着的权威和影响力。</p><p>奥尔森医生很忙。 她负责管理医生和患者服务。 医院设施由总务副总裁尼古拉斯·安德森 (Nicholas Anderson) 管理。 医院技术设备和人员配置的采购和管理由财务总监 Marid Diaz 负责。 副总裁和财务总监是 Olsen 博士的管理同事（请参阅布里斯兰医院的组织结构图）。</p><p>Brisland Hospital Organization Chart</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="image-20240514164108105"></p><ul><li>As the project manager, what advantages could you have with hospital COO being the project sponsor?</li><li>How could Dr. Olsen&#39;s busy schedule affect your ability to manage the project?</li><li>What advantages will Dr. Olsen&#39;s responsibility as manager of Physician and Patient Services provide to your project?</li></ul><h3 id="sample-solution" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sample-solution"><span>Sample solution</span></a></h3><p><strong>Project Management Foundations</strong> with Bonnie Biafore</p><p>Chapter 1 Solution</p><p>While we can never be completely certain about what may happen on a project, the culture and organizational structure for the hospital will have an effect, so it is important to consider the challenge questions. Here are my answers to these questions, which you can compare to your own thoughts:</p><ol><li><p>What advantages might you experience due to Dr. Olsen’s position as the hospital COO?</p><p>As the COO, Dr. Olsen will have significant influence and exposure to a large percentage of activity in the hospital. She will be very knowledgeable and understand how the hospital’s culture and organization will affect your project. That information will be critical for you to successfully guide the project.</p></li><li><p>What advantages and disadvantages will Dr. Olsen’s busyness provide relative to your ability to man-age the project?</p><p>Dr. Olsen’s time for assisting you will be limited. Her allocation of time to your project will probably be influenced by the hospital’s culture for supporting projects. As a project manager, you will have to use Dr. Olsen’s time wisely and efficiently. You may also have to be flexible when working with her to accommodate her schedule and management priorities.</p></li><li><p>What advantages will Dr. Olsen’s responsibility as manager of Physician and Patient Services provide to your project? What potential disadvantages will the management responsibilities of others (the purchase and management of the hospital’s technical equipment and staffing) have to your project?</p><p>Because your project involves scheduling hospital facilities for the benefit of patients and physicians, Dr. Olsen will have direct influence over significant aspects of your project, which is a valuable organizational advantage. However, with the new cancer ward construction and the amount and availability of facilities is managed by others, Dr. Olsen’s influence will be indirect. You and Dr. Olsen will have to work closely with her management peers. You will need to understand the organizational influence and the management culture that exists among the hospital’s management team. At best, it is a disadvantage because it will involve more time and effort working with other significant stakeholders. At worst, if Dr. Olsen and her peers don’t have good working relationships or they have differing opinions, you may require significant negotiation and finesse to manage the project. The culture of how decisions are made and how disagreements are resolved will influence the management of this project.</p></li></ol><h2 id="quiz" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#quiz"><span>Quiz</span></a></h2><ol><li>Your project seems to be going off track, so you take action to resolve the problem.
