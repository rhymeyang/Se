If the user “contaminates” the training data intentionally by submitting inaccurate input data, it can cause the ML algorithm to malfunction or crash at the time of inference. To protect the attacker from modifying the ML data outputs, a standard application like anomaly detection can be used to train data sent by the user.</li><li><strong>Attacks during inference time:</strong> In second phase ofML, i.e., inference phase, the privacy of the user must be maintained by protecting the user’s private data. Let us consider an insider attacker situation where the user behaves maliciously. In this case, the user himself employs an attack called adversarial examples, where he feds legitimate input data to the ML model and the ML misinterprets the data.
