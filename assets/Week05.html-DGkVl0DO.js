sensationalist and the OBD port as having the highest risk in their respective category.</li><li>The former mirrors well the majority of the attacks that have been widely documented and discussed.</li><li>These were conducted by different researchers and experts that wanted to show how insecure the vehicles really are.</li><li>The final goal of the researchers was maybe not to get famous and hit the headlines of all news portals in the world, but it was definitely the outcome of their research and as such has to be taken into consideration.</li><li>The OBD port is shown to have the highest risk potential, and even though it requires physical access there are some cases where it can be exploited remotely.</li><li>It is also the oldest interface in the CEL library and accessing the OBD port gives the attacker almost full access to the CAN network.</li></ul><hr><ul><li>Unlike the TARA method, STRIDE has been used before in the automotive industry.</li><li>However, the method in this chapter was conducted by using the MS Threat modeling tool along with the template designed for the automotive industry, and this was not done before.</li><li>The template used with the MS Threat modeling tool has shown to be very useful and adaptable, where further work may allow this template to be used on even more low-level software applications.</li><li>The results generated by the tool described in this chapter are maybe not completely comprehensive but they clearly show the extent of vulnerabilities of an AUTOSAR-based software application.</li><li>Even though the application in question, the vehicle’s interior lights, does not seem like something worth analyzing, one can just imagine driving down the highway in the middle of the night when suddenly the lights in the car start going on/off every second—it could distract the driver or even cause an accident.</li></ul><h2 id="_4-3-in-vehicle-communication" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor"
