For Windows 2000, use the IPCONFIG utility. </p></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Winnt.exe</div></td><td><div><p> The executable you use to install Windows 2000 on a computer that does not have a previous version of Windows 95, 98, or NT installed. </p></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Winnt32.exe</div></td><td><div><p> The executable you use to re-install or upgrade Windows 2000 on a computer that already has Windows 95, 98, or NT installed. </p></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>WINS (Windows Internet Naming Service)</div></td><td><div><p> A component of Microsoft Windows NT Server that resolves NetBIOS names into IP addresses for computers and resources on the network using a dynamically-updated database. </p></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>WINS Manager</div></td><td><div><p> A Microsoft utility that is used to manage the Microsoft Windows Internet Name Service. With this utility, you can make configuration changes to your WINS server such as disabling logging or configuring static mappings. </p></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Winsock (Windows socket service)</div></td><td><div><p> Winsock provides a standard application programming interface to transport protocols such as TCP/IP and IPX. Network applications can use this interface to use the services of the TCP/IP protocol stack. </p></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Wire crimper</div></td><td><div><p> A tool used to attach cable connectors to bare wires (by crimping), such as when you are making your own cables. </p></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)</div></td><td><div><p> WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) was designed to provide wireless networks the same type of protection that cables provide on a wired network. WEP requires that authorized users have a valid WEP key to communicate with the access point. Likewise, cables provide this type of protection in that a client can only communicate with a hub or router if they have an active network cable connected to them. </p><p> On a wireless network that is employing WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy), only users with the correct WEP key are allowed to authenticate through the WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) access points. That&#39;s the whole point of WEP, to prevent unauthorized users by employing a wireless session key for access. </p></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Wireless</div></td><td><div><p> Wireless networking uses radio waves or infrared light (with the air as the transmission medium) to send data between hosts. Wireless networks are common in homes, businesses, airports, and hotels. Most wireless networks connect into larger wired networks (such as LANs) which are in turn connected to the Internet. </p></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Wireless Application Protocol (WAP)</div></td><td><div><p> WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) access points privacy, integrity, and authentication to wireless client devices and using WTLS (Wireless Transport Layer Security). WTLS is a wireless security services protocol. It protects data between the wireless hub/router/access point and all wireless NICs. </p></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Workgroup</div></td><td><div><p> A peer-to-peer network where each Windows 2000 workstation is a member of a logical grouping of computers. The workgroup model has no central user account database or computer that validates a logon. Each Windows 2000 workstation in a workgroup must contain accounts for every person who needs to gain access to resources on that workstation. Workgroups are convenient for very small networks, but because there is no central database for maintaining accounts, administration is difficult. </p></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Workstation-only backup</div></td><td><div><p> A backup technique that allows users to back up the critical information they store on their own local computer. Each computer needs its own backup device and storage media. </p></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>World Wide Web</div></td><td><div><p> A graphically-based and user-friendly part of the Internet. You need a software application called an Internet browser (to view the information on the World Wide Web. The World Wide Web uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to connect a system of graphical pages, called Web sites, formatted using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). </p></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Worms</div></td><td><div><p> Pieces of software code written expressly to cause problems with servers and workstations by &quot;tunneling&quot; through the data and code on the hard drive. Worms are a type of computer virus. </p></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>WOW (Windows-on-Windows)</div></td><td><div><p> Win16 on Win32. A 32-bit program inside Windows NT that lets you run Win16 applications. WOW works inside an NTVDM. </p></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Write-ahead log</div></td><td><div><p> A method of logging transactions. Using this method, the log is always written to disk before the data. </p></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>WSH (Windows Scripting Host)</div></td><td><div><p> A scripting host that lets you run scripts, batch files, and command files from the command prompt or the Windows desktop. </p></div></td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="x" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#x"><span>X</span></a></h3><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><div>X.400 standard</div></td><td><div><p> The X.400 standard contains guidelines for exchanging messages electronically. It includes rules for addressing messages as well as an addressing scheme that uses management domains, originator/recipient names, and other information to uniquely identify users within the hierarchy of the organization. </p></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>X.500</div></td><td><div><p> X.500 is a set of recommendations from the International Telecommunications Union. It lays out the rules that allow combining local directory services into one global directory. </p></div></td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="y" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#y"><span>Y</span></a></h3><h3 id="z" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#z"><span>Z</span></a></h3><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><div>ZAP File</div></td><td><div><p> A text file that references a conventional setup program. The ZAP file can be distributed to network users using Active Directory-based Group Policy Objects (GPOs). </p></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Zeroconf</div></td><td><div><p> Zero Configuration Networking (Zeroconf) is a standards-based initiative of an IETF working groups whose goals are to: </p><ul><li> Make current computer network administration easier by performing configuration tasks automatically without the need for network services such as DNS or DHCP </li><li> Enable the creation and implementation of a new generation of network related products </li><li> Accomplish all of this without disrupting the existing network infrastructure of large networks </li></ul><p> With Zeroconf, you should be able to connect two computers and automatically have them be able to communicate. You should also be able to set up a small network (even a network with multiple subnets or connected to the Internet) by simply connecting devices and without performing any additional configuration tasks. </p></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Zone</div></td><td><div><p> A portion of the DNS namespace made up of a single domain or of a domain and subdomains that are administered as a single, separate entity. </p><p> A particular name server is responsible for each zone. The name server stores all address mappings for the domain name space with the zone. It also answers client queries for those names. </p></div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Zone transfer</div></td><td><div><p> The process of replicating updates to the zone information among multiple DNS servers. Regular zone transfers are necessary because as computers and other devices are added to or removed from a network, host names and IP addresses change. </p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div><!--[--><!--]--></div><footer class="vp-page-meta"><!----><div class="vp-meta-item git-info"><div class="vp-meta-item last-updated"><span class="meta-item-label">Last Updated: </span><!----></div><!----></div></footer><!----><!--[--><!--]--></main><!--]--></div><!--[--><!----><!--]--><!--]--></div>
