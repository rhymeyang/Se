This is a critical step in ensuring that automotive systems are secure throughout their lifecycle.</p><h2 id="key-objectives-of-tara-in-iso-sae-21434" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#key-objectives-of-tara-in-iso-sae-21434"><span><strong>Key Objectives of TARA in ISO/SAE 21434:</strong></span></a></h2><ol><li><strong>Identify Assets and Risks</strong>: Identify the critical components or systems (assets) that need to be protected.</li><li><strong>Analyze Potential Threats</strong>: Analyze possible cybersecurity threats to those assets.</li><li><strong>Assess Vulnerabilities</strong>: Identify weaknesses that could be exploited by the threats.</li><li><strong>Assess Impact and Likelihood</strong>: Evaluate the potential impact of a successful cyberattack and how likely it is to happen.</li><li><strong>Define Security Measures</strong>: Based on the assessment, determine what security controls or measures are needed to mitigate or reduce the risks.</li></ol><h3 id="steps-involved-in-tara-as-per-iso-sae-21434" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#steps-involved-in-tara-as-per-iso-sae-21434"><span>Steps Involved in TARA as per ISO/SAE 21434:</span></a></h3><ol><li><strong>Asset Identification</strong>: <ul><li>Identify the <strong>assets</strong> within the system that need protection. Assets can include hardware components, software systems, communication interfaces, data, and even user information.</li><li>Assets should be classified based on their importance or criticality. For example, critical components such as an <strong>Electronic Control Unit (ECU)</strong> that manages braking may require higher security protection compared to a non-critical infotainment system.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Threat Identification</strong>: <ul><li>Identify potential <strong>threats</strong> that could target the identified assets. Threats can come from external attackers, insider threats, or unintentional errors that could compromise the system.</li><li>Threats should be categorized based on their nature, such as <strong>physical attacks</strong> (e.g., tampering with the hardware), <strong>software attacks</strong> (e.g., exploiting software vulnerabilities), or <strong>communication attacks</strong> (e.g., man-in-the-middle attacks on vehicle networks).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Vulnerability Identification</strong>: <ul><li>Once threats are identified, analyze the system to identify <strong>vulnerabilities</strong> that could be exploited by these threats. Vulnerabilities are weaknesses in the system that an attacker could exploit to compromise an asset.</li><li>Vulnerabilities may arise from insecure coding practices, poor access control, lack of encryption, or inadequate system design.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Impact Assessment</strong>: <ul><li>Assess the potential <strong>impact</strong> of a successful attack on each identified asset. The impact is evaluated based on how much harm or damage the attack could cause.</li><li>This includes considering the consequences for safety (e.g., loss of control of the vehicle), financial loss, operational disruption, or damage to the company&#39;s reputation.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Likelihood Assessment</strong>: <ul><li>Assess the <strong>likelihood</strong> of a threat successfully exploiting a vulnerability. The likelihood is influenced by factors such as the complexity of the attack, the skill level required, and the availability of the exploit.</li><li>The higher the likelihood of an attack being successful, the greater the risk it poses.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Risk Determination</strong>: <ul><li>Once the <strong>impact</strong> and <strong>likelihood</strong> are determined, the <strong>risk level</strong> for each threat is calculated. Risk is typically expressed as the product of impact and likelihood representing the severity of the potential threat.</li><li>Risks are then categorized into levels such as low, medium, high, or critical, depending on the results of the assessment.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Risk Treatment</strong>: <ul><li>Based on the risk levels, appropriate <strong>risk treatment measures</strong> or <strong>security controls</strong> are determined to mitigate or reduce the risks. These could include technical solutions like encryption, authentication mechanisms, or secure communication protocols, as well as organizational measures like access control policies and monitoring systems.</li><li>In cases where the risk is too high and cannot be mitigated, other strategies such as risk avoidance (modifying the system design) or risk transfer (outsourcing security responsibilities) may be considered.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Cybersecurity Goals and Requirements</strong>: <ul><li>Based on the TARA results, define <strong>cybersecurity goals and requirements</strong>. These goals guide the design and implementation of security measures in the system development process.</li><li>For example, if a risk of unauthorized access to vehicle control systems is identified, a cybersecurity goal might be to ensure secure access control to critical vehicle functions.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Risk Monitoring and Review</strong>: <ul><li>Risks are not static, so ongoing <strong>monitoring and review</strong> are necessary to ensure that new threats, vulnerabilities, and risks are identified and managed over time.</li><li>This step involves updating the threat analysis and risk assessment as new information becomes available or when the system undergoes changes.</li></ul></li></ol><h3 id="key-concepts-in-tara-as-per-iso-sae-21434" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#key-concepts-in-tara-as-per-iso-sae-21434"><span>Key Concepts in TARA as per ISO/SAE 21434:</span></a></h3><ol><li><p><strong>Cybersecurity Assurance Levels (CALs)</strong>:</p><ul><li>ISO 21434 introduces the concept of <strong>Cybersecurity Assurance Levels (CALs)</strong>, which classify the system based on the level of cybersecurity needed. CALs range from CAL 1 (low) to CAL 4 (very high).</li><li>The level is determined based on the outcome of the TARA, with higher assurance levels requiring more stringent security controls.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA Triad)</strong>:</p><ul><li>The CIA Triad is often used to frame security requirements and threats. In automotive cybersecurity, it refers to: <ul><li><strong>Confidentiality</strong>: Ensuring that sensitive information (e.g., vehicle data, user information) is protected from unauthorized access.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Integrity</strong>: Ensuring that data and system functions are not tampered with or altered by unauthorized parties.</li><li><strong>Availability</strong>: Ensuring that critical vehicle functions and data are available and functional when needed (e.g., braking systems must always be available).</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>STRIDE Threat Modeling</strong>:</p><ul><li>ISO/SAE 21434 often uses the <strong>STRIDE</strong> model to categorize threats. STRIDEstands for: <ul><li><strong>S</strong>poofing (pretending to be someone else),</li><li><strong>T</strong>ampering (modifying data),</li><li><strong>R</strong>epudiation (denying an action),</li><li><strong>I</strong>nformation Disclosure (leaking sensitive data),</li><li><strong>D</strong>enial of Service (disrupting availability),</li><li><strong>E</strong>levation of Privilege (gaining unauthorized control).</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Damage Scenarios</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Damage Scenarios</strong> are used to assess the potential impact of cybersecurity incidents. Each scenario describes what could happen if a specific threat exploits a vulnerability (e.g., a remote hacker taking control of a car’s steering system).</li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>Benefits of TARA in ISO/SAE 21434:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Proactive Risk Mitigation</strong>: By identifying threats and vulnerabilities early in the vehicle’s development process, organizations can mitigate risks before they become critical issues.</li><li><strong>Informed Decision Making</strong>: TARA provides a clear understanding of the risks involved, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions about which risks to accept and which to mitigate.</li><li><strong>Compliance</strong>: Performing TARA ensures compliance with regulatory requirements like <strong>UNECE WP.29</strong>, which mandates cybersecurity risk assessments as part of the Cybersecurity Management System (CSMS).</li></ul></div><!--[--><!--]--></div><footer class="vp-page-meta"><!----><div class="vp-meta-item git-info"><div class="vp-meta-item last-updated"><span class="meta-item-label">Last Updated: </span><!----></div><!----></div></footer><nav class="vp-page-nav" aria-label="page navigation"><a class="route-link auto-link prev" href="/Se/300/01_Tara.html" aria-label="Tara PPT"><div class="hint"><span class="arrow left"></span> Prev</div><div class="link"><span>Tara PPT</span></div></a><a class="route-link auto-link next" href="/Se/300/question.html" aria-label="Questions"><div class="hint">Next <span class="arrow right"></span></div><div class="link"><span>Questions</span></div></a></nav><!--[--><!--]--></main><!--]--></div><!--[--><!----><!--]--><!--]--></div>
