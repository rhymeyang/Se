future autonomous vehicles.</li><li>The key four trends are autonomous driving, connectivity, diverse mobility, and electrification of the vehicles as shown in Fig. 8.7.</li><li>The riders and drivers use vehicle connectivity and subsequent autonomous technological service models to become a medium for their transport and for personal purpose.</li><li>The accelerating progress allows automobiles to

be constantly aware of advances in technology, which will further increase demand for upgradability of privately owned vehicles.</li><li>In addition, strict emission standards, lower battery prices, commonly available charging points, and increased consumer awareness will develop new and growing support for the adoption of electric powered vehicles such as hybrid, plug-in, battery electric, and fuel cell, in the coming years, which will vary significantly at regional and local levels.</li></ul><p><img src="/Se/images/302/w0807.png" alt="Picture1"></p><p><strong>Fig. 8.7</strong> Basic trends

networks makes it easier to accomplish autonomous vehicles that do not need human interference except in complex traffic scenarios. <ul><li>The use of human accessibility systems should be fully reshaped.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> The connectivity services in vehicles provide networking of vehicles with other vehicles and infrastructures such as RSU and clouds as well as provide Internet connectivity for Web surfing, work, or accessing multimedia services during the journey.</li><li><strong>Diverse Mobility:</strong> The shared mobility has been offered by many developed countries. However, sharing concepts of autonomous vehicles will be economically viable soon. <ul><li>The quest for a shared vehicle in the local area would no longer be necessary: Rather, vehicles will be requested anywhere the consumer happens to be through a convenient “on-demand” service know as mobility-asa-service.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Electrification:</strong> The shift to emission-free autonomous vehicle would not be possible without electrification of the vehicles. <ul><li>There is problem even with a very small amount of harmful substances, dust, and noise generated by the current vehicles operated on non-renewable gasoline fuels.</li></ul></li></ol><h3 id="_8-5-2-autonomous-electric-vehicle-and-challenges" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_8-5-2-autonomous-electric-vehicle-and-challenges"><span>8.5.2 Autonomous Electric Vehicle and Challenges</span></a></h3><ul><li>Several countries in the world propose to a ban on the selling of gasoline and diesel vehicles by shifting to electric and hybrid vehicles.</li><li>Countries in Europe like Norway prohibit fossil fuel vehicles and create opportunities for electric vehicles.</li><li>All other countries will also follow this trend for cleaner, greener, and healthier environment, while fossil fuels have limited supply.</li><li>The future will be full of autonomous and electric vehicles over time, and it will likely become the preferred form of transportation with the goal of moving ahead with more sustainable and efficient e-mobility alternatives.</li><li>The charging facilities would be a critical factor in maintaining a seamless transition to e-mobility.</li><li>Innovations with novel EV charging solutions are required that would play a key role for EVs.
