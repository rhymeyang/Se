witnessing a global change where all the devices in our surroundings are becoming “smart” and connected to the Internet.</p><p>The automotive industry is also a part of this change.</p><p>Today’s vehicles have more than 150 small computers, embedded control units (ECUs), and multiple connection points to the Internet which makes them vulnerable to various online threats.</p><p>Recent attacks on connected vehicles have all been results of security vulnerabilities that could have been avoided if appropriate risk assessment methods were in place during software development.</p><h2 id="_5-2-introduction" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-2-introduction"><span>5.2 INTRODUCTION</span></a></h2><p>The world as we know it is changing and many of the devices we use daily are becoming “smart.”</p><p>This buzzword is appearing in everything from smart grids to smart homes with the smart appliances therein.</p><p>The main aspect of these devices is their connection to the Internet, and because of it, previously local vulnerabilities are now widely exposed.</p><p>More than 100 embedded ECUs could be integrated in advanced vehicles.</p><p>A high-end car may now have more than 100 million lines of code [1], as well as multiple connections to external networks including the Internet.</p><p>All this code has to be properly developed and tested in order to ensure the safety and security of the vehicle. We will refer to these types of cars as connected cars.</p><p>Even though the connection to the outside world enables many new services, it also exposes the car and its software to a potential remote attack.</p><p>There have already been a number of successful cyberattacks on connected vehicles such as the attacks on Jeep Cherokee, Tesla S model, Nissan electric car, and Chevrolet Corvette.</p><h3 id="_5-2-1-1-tara" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-2-1-1-tara"><span>5.2.1.1 TARA</span></a></h3><p>The threat agent risk assessment (TARA) method was developed by security experts from Intel Security and is based on three groups of collected data, denoted as libraries:</p><ul><li><strong>Threat Agent Library (TAL)</strong><ul><li>lists all relevant threat agents and their corresponding attributes.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Methods and Objectives Library (MOL)</strong><ul><li>lists methods that each threat agent might employ along with a corresponding impact level.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Common Exposure Library (CEL)</strong><ul><li>lists areas of the greatest exposure and vulnerability.</li></ul></li></ul><p>These libraries are populated internally inside a company by their security expert team.</p><p>They are based on incident reports, breach reports, security measures, and other confidential information that is required to create the libraries.</p><p>By using the information from the libraries, security experts can determine which threat agent attributes are needed in order for a threat agent to pose a threat to the company and its assets.</p><h3 id="_5-2-1-2-stride" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-2-1-2-stride"><span>5.2.1.2 STRIDE</span></a></h3><p>The STRIDE method was originally developed by Microsoft.</p><p>The method allows threat identification in the design phase of any software or hardware and as such gives insight into potential attack scenarios. There are two variants of the STRIDE method: per-interaction and per-element.</p><p>In order to apply the method, security experts first need to create data flow diagrams (DFD) of the system that needs to be analyzed.</p><p>The DFDs present the communication patterns between the components under investigation.</p><p>Afterward, the method examines these diagrams in order to detect possible threats to the system. The threats are divided into six different categories: spoofing, tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service, elevation of privileges.</p><p>The inspection of DFD diagrams can be done manually (brainstorming sessions) or by using the Microsoft Threat modeling tool which uses the STRIDE per-interaction variant.</p><h3 id="_5-2-1-3-autosar" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-2-1-3-autosar"><span>5.2.1.3 AUTOSAR</span></a></h3><ul><li>AUTomotive Open System Architecture (AUTOSAR) was founded in 2003, with the goal to develop an architecture, independent of the underlying ECU hardware that the automotive industry can use to reduce the increasing complexity of software in modern vehicles.</li><li>It is the de facto standard for the automotive software today, and 80% of global production is based on this standard.</li><li>AUTOSAR makes an abstract layer of the underlying hardware, so that the applications written on top of AUTOSAR are independent from the actual supplier of the ECU hardware.</li><li>The AUTOSAR standard defines security mechanisms that can be used by the software modules implemented into the vehicle system.</li><li>It further specifies interfaces and procedures to provide Secure On-Board Communication, and the exact implementation is left for the OEMs to decide on.</li><li>OEMs choose the cryptographic algorithms and encryption techniques which they want to implement and use in the vehicle system.</li><li>The three main security mechanisms in the AUTOSAR are Crypto Service Manager (CSM), Crypto Abstraction Library (CAL), and Secure On-Board Communication (SecOC).</li></ul><h4 id="a-software-architecture" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#a-software-architecture"><span>A.

class="header-anchor" href="#_5-5-4-discussion-and-future-work"><span>5.5.4 DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK</span></a></h3><ul><li>The TARA method is rather new with little supporting documentation except what is published by Intel Security.</li><li>For that reason, additional work had to be conducted in order to successfully adapt and apply the method to the automotive industry.</li><li>The method ranked the sensationalist and the OBD port as having the highest risk in their respective category.</li><li>The former mirrors well the majority of the attacks that have been widely documented and discussed.</li><li>These were conducted by different researchers and experts that wanted to show how insecure the vehicles really are.</li><li>The final goal of the researchers was maybe not to get famous and hit the headlines of all news portals in the world, but it was definitely the outcome of their research and as such has to be taken into consideration.</li><li>The OBD port is shown to have the highest risk potential, and even though it requires physical access there are some cases where it can be exploited remotely.</li><li>It is also the oldest interface in the CEL library and accessing the OBD port gives the attacker almost full access to the CAN network.</li></ul><hr><ul><li>Unlike the TARA method, STRIDE has been used before in the automotive industry.</li><li>However, the method in this chapter was conducted by using the MS Threat modeling tool along with the template designed for the automotive industry, and this was not done before.</li><li>The template used with the MS Threat modeling tool has shown to be very useful and adaptable, where further work may allow this template to be used on even more low-level software applications.</li><li>The results generated by the tool described in this chapter are maybe not completely comprehensive but they clearly show the extent of vulnerabilities of an AUTOSAR-based software application.</li><li>Even though the application in question, the vehicle’s interior lights, does not seem like something worth analyzing, one can just imagine driving down the highway in the middle of the night when suddenly the lights in the car start going on/off every second—it could distract the driver or even cause an accident.</li></ul><h2 id="_4-3-in-vehicle-communication" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-3-in-vehicle-communication"><span>4.3 IN-VEHICLE COMMUNICATION</span></a></h2><ul><li>The in-vehicle communication refers to the intra vehicle communication where all the internal components like telematics, sensors, and actuators communicate with each other using different communication mediums like standard bus system.</li><li>The in-vehicle communication occurs within the internal vehicle communication network where the ECUs intercommunicate with other electronic subsystems.</li><li>The ECUs are connected within vehicle bus systems through specialized internal communication networks.</li><li>Most ECUs are connected to one or more bus networks for monitoring and controlling the vehicles.</li><li>Some ECUs are connected to external controls, such as digital equipment, infotainment, and navigation systems via a gateway system.</li><li>The central gateway-based architecture links the entire IVN with a central gateway and provides smooth connectivity between heterogeneous network protocols.</li></ul><h2 id="_5-6-conclusion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_5-6-conclusion"><span>5.6 CONCLUSION</span></a></h2><ul><li>In this chapter, we adapted two threat modeling methods from the computer industry in order to better fit the needs of the automotive industry.</li><li>The next step was to apply these methods to the connected car and the underlying software architecture, which in turn generated valuable results that were carefully validated.</li><li>The entire work was done with the support of domain experts from different companies that have extensive knowledge in this field.</li><li>TARA was used to provide a high-level overview of threats in the area of connected vehicles while STRIDE was used to evaluate a specific functionality of the vehicle.</li><li>The three libraries created by the TARA method and the template used by the STRIDE method would be a good starting point for any future application.</li><li>Finally, it is important to learn from the mistakes made by the computer industry, but it is also vital to recognize which threat modeling methods and which security mechanisms from the computer industry can be applied to the automotive industry.</li></ul></div><!--[--><!--]--></div><footer class="vp-page-meta"><!----><div class="vp-meta-item git-info"><div
